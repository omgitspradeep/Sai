<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910 December 4, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Bombay.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, by the time I finished my prayer, Waman Rao Joshi came but went away soon to see Mr Khopkar. Rambhau showed me his papers and I sat reading them. His case appears good but would require work in England &amp; I told him accordingly. After the midday meal I lay down for sometime &amp;then sat reading Morpant &rsquo;s life by Pangarkar. Waman Rao Joshi, Anuva Anand whose present real name is Himmatlal Dirvidi also came. Padhya High Court Vakerl came with Purandare &amp; sat talking. He has a Privy Council case to give. After they went, Purandare came again with Pathare. The latter wishes to give his daughter in marriage to Bodhankar&rsquo;s nephew. We sat talking for a long time. I intend going away today or rather tonight. Baba went out in the afternoon &amp; came in the evening. Dhaujisha, Waman Rao Joshi, his brother Baba Purandare, Pathare &amp; others are present. We shall leave by 10.15 P.M. train.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910 December 5, Monday</strong><br /><em>Manmad -Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night I &amp; my son Baba left by 10.15 P.M. train as proposed. Purandare, Pathare, Dhaujisha, his woodman, Bapu &amp; others came to the station to see us off &amp; the first two brought flowers. I slept as soon as I got into my compartment though I was awakened often. We reached Manmad about 9 A.M. today and stayed at the Railway station till nearly 1 P.M. I met one or two young men, on the station staff who very kindly helped us with things. One Haripant of Yeola also met us. In the train to Copargaon, we met an Englishman who appeared exceptionally good mannered and obliging. We reached Copargaon station about 2 P.M. hired two conveyances, one for things and the other for ourselves to travel in. Bhaskar Rao assisted us with tongas and gave us guavas to eat at his house and accompanied us to Shirdi, which we reached about 4 P.M.. We put up in the wada built for the convenience of people by Mr Chandkar. Madhavrao Deshpande was very obliging &amp; helped us &amp; treated us like guests. There are in the Wada Tatyasaheb Nulkar with his family, Bapusaheb Jog and Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all went to see Sayin Maharaj soon after our arrival. He was in the Masjid. After salutations I &amp; my son offered the fruits brought by us &amp; gave some money at his request. The Sayin Saheb then said that he has not been well for the last two years &amp; more, that he used to eat only barley cake &amp; take a little water. He showed his foot and pointed to a small sore, said it was the string worm, that it was extracted but the string snapped &amp; then it reappeared &amp; so on. He said he heard that it would not be well with him till he went to his native town. He said he kept it in view but that was all, he cared more for his people than even for his own life. He said he found no rest as people troubled him. It could not be helped. Then he told us to withdraw which we did. Towards evening he passed by the wada &amp; we went &amp; saluted him. I &amp; Madhavrao Deshpande were together. After we saluted he &ldquo;Go to the wada &amp; sit quiet.&rdquo; So I &amp; Madhavrao returned. We all sat talking. They have many miracles to relate. I, Baba &amp; Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe had something to eat at night and after I returned to bed, a strange thing happened. The wife of Das Ganu who has written the &ldquo;Arvachim Sant lilamrit &rdquo; &amp; known as Tai came &amp; lay down by my side. I do not know how long she lay like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910 December 6, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, the poor woman Tai was much discussed &amp; they blamed her. I feel pity for her insanity. I had a walk, &amp; after bath we all saw Sayin Maharaj going out with an embroidered big umbrella held over his head. Later on we went to Masjid. Sayin Maharaj was talking. He said speaking to himself there is no use being threatened. It does no good. Why should we threaten?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are very high officers of God. They are very powerful. The same thing was repeated very often. He appeared somewhat excited. Then he got up, distributed the food accumulated there, and after giving udi-ashes requested us to withdraw. We did so. The midday meal was not served nearly half-past two in the afternoon. After it we sat talking, saw Sayin Maharaj in the evening when he came out for a walk. Later on we went to the Chavadi where Sayin Maharaj sleeps tonight. He was accompanied by the Umbrella of State, silver stick, chavaris &amp; fans etc. The place was tastefully lighted. The lady who is known as Radha Krishna came out with lights. She is related to Babasaheb Deshpande of Ahmednagar. I saw her from a distance. Madhavrao Deshpande said he would be away tomorrow &amp; return the day after. He asked for &amp; obtained Sayin Maharaja &rsquo;s permission to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<br /><strong>1910, December 7, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after my prayer Balasaheb Bhate who is a retired Mamlatdar came to the Wada &amp; sat talking with us. He has been staying here for sometime, &amp; has a peculiar kind of calm on his face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw Sayin Maharaj as he was going out &amp; went to him in the Masjid in the afternoon. I, Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe, my son Baba, Bapusaheb Jog, &amp; children went together &amp; sat there. Sayin Maharaj appeared to be in good humour. He asked Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe whether he came from Bombay. Babasaheb replied in the affirmative. Babasaheb was then asked whether he would return to Bombay. He again replied in the affirmative, but added that he could not be certain of remaining there, as it would depend upon circumstances. Sayin Maharaj remarked &ldquo;Yes. It is true, you have many things on hand &amp; have to undertake more. You should remain here some four or five days. You will be here, you should see for yourself. The experiences gone through are real. They are not fanciful. I was here thousands years ago. &rdquo;Then Sayin Maharaj turned to me &amp; started on apparently a new track. He said &ldquo;This world is funny. All are my subjects. I look upon all equally, but some have become thieves and what can I do for them? People who are themselves very near death, desire &amp; make preparations for the death of others. They offended me a great deal. They hurt me a good deal but I said nothing. I kept quiet. God is very great &amp; has his officers every where. They are all powerful. One must be content with the state in which God keeps him. But I am very powerful. I was here eight or ten thousand years ago.&rdquo; My son asked him to tell a story as he told him before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sayin Maharaj asked what story it was. My son replied that it was a story about three brothers who went to a Masjid. One of them wished to go out and beg. The others did not want him to do that on the ground that the food obtained by begging would be impure and would pollute their chowka. The third brother replied that if the food spoiled the chowka, his legs should be cut off &amp; so on. Sayin Maharaj said it was a very good story. He would tell another when he was in the humour. My son said he did not know when the thing would happen, &amp; if the humour recurred after he left, there would not be much use. Thereupon-Sayin Saheb told him that he should rest assured that the story would be told before he left.I ak\sked him why he was angry yesterday and he replied that it was because the Teli said something. Then I asked him why he cried out "Do not Beat. Do not beat" today at the time of the distribution of food, and he replied that he cried out because the patil family was quarrelling and divided among themselves. Sayin Sahib spoke with such a wonderful sweetness and he smilled so often and with such extraordinary grace that the conversation will remain engraved in my memory. Unfortunately other people came and the conversation was interrupted. We were so sorry for it but it could not be helped. We returned talking about it. Tatyasahib Nulkar was not present during the first part of the conversation but came later on. Balasahib Bhate came in the evening and we sat again talking about conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910, 8 December, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after prayer, we saw Sayin saheb as usual when he was going out. Later on we went to see him in the afternoon but had to turn back as he was washing his feet. Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe, myself &amp; my son and Mr. Pradhan who came this morning formed the company that went &amp; had to return. Tatyasaheb Nulkar did not accompany us. Later on we went again, but Sayin Saheb dismissed us very soon. So we returned. He appeared very much engaged in thinking out something. At night, Sayinsaheb slept in the Chavadi &amp; we went to see the procession. It was very nice. Pradhan mentioned above is a police officer, I believe, head constable. He was charged with extorting money &amp; tried by the court of Sessions. He vowed to visit Sayin Maharaj if he was acquitted. He was acquitted &amp; came to fulfill his vow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On seeing him Sayin Maharaj appeared affected &amp; said &ldquo;Why did you not stay a few days there? The poor people must have felt disappointed.&rdquo; He repeated this twice. We learned afterwards that Pradhan&rsquo;s friends pressed him to stay &amp; that he did not comply with their request. He had never seen Sayinsaheb before &amp; of course the latter could not have seen him before. The wonder is how Sayin Maharaj knew him &amp; said what he did..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910, 9 December Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I &amp; my son intended going away today. In the morning, after prayer when we went as usual to see Sayin Maharaj, he asked my son if he intended going away &amp; added that we may go away. We thought the necessary permission had been granted &amp; made ready to start. Baba packed all things, &amp; engaged a spring cart &amp; another to carry our things, &amp; in the afternoon went to formally see the Sayin Maharaj before actually starting. On seeing me Sayinsaheb said &ldquo;Do you really intend going?&rdquo; I replied &ldquo;I wish to go but not if you do not permit.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Then you may go tomorrow or the day after. This is our house. The Wada is our house &amp; why need any body be afraid while I am here. This is our house &amp; you should look upon it as your own house.&rdquo; I agreed to stay &amp; countermanded all arrangements for departure. We sat down talking. Sayin Maharaj was in a very pleasant mood, &amp; said many pleasant things but I am afraid, I did not understand him. A young man by name Shridhan Mongi came. He is very good &amp; carefully brought up. Sayin Maharaj got him to stay on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Pradhan is also very nice. We, i.e. I, Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe &amp; Pradhan went out for a long walk. My son Baba &amp; Mr. Nulkar went out also with us but remained behind.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910, 10 December ,Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after prayer I told my son Baba never to mention anything about our going away to Sayin Maharaj. He knows all &amp; would know when to send us away. As usual we Sayin Saheb as he was going out &amp; later on when we went to the Masjid. Sayin Saheb was very much pleased and told the story of a former life of a young girl who was playing with him. He said she was an artist &amp; died &amp; was usual buried. Sayin Saheb passed that way &amp; spent a night near her tomb. So she accompanied him. He kept her in a Babul tree and then brought her here. He said he was Kabir before &amp; used to spin yarn. The conversation was exceedingly pleasant. In the afternoon Mr. Shridhan Paranjape of Wardha accompanied by one Mr Pandit, another doctor &amp; a third, came. Mr Patwardhan junior of Ahmednagar was there. My son &amp; he are old college friends. They all went to see Sayinsaheb &amp; we all accompanied them. Sayinsaheb treated them, the same way as he treats every body, &amp; and talked first of Teli, Marwadi ,etc. Then he talked of buildings that are being put up &amp; added &ldquo;The world is gone mad. Every man has acquired a peculiarity of evil thinking. I never put myself on an equality with any of them. So I never listen to what they say. Nay. I never reply. What should I reply.&rdquo; He then distributed &ldquo;Udi &rdquo; &amp; told us to return to the wada. He singled out Patwardhan junior &amp; told him to stay behind, as usual mentioning &ldquo;tomorrow &rdquo; as the day of departure. I &amp; Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe returned to the wada. It appears Paranjape &amp; his companions went to the lady Radhakrishna. Somehow Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe went there, but apparently was not treated as he deserved to be. Bapu Saheb Jog &rsquo;s wife has been ill. She has benefited very much by what Sayinsaheb says &amp; gives as medicine but apparently she lost patience today &amp; wanted to go away -even Bapusaheb Jog, out of sheer helplessness agreed to let her go. Sayin Saheb, made repeated enquiries about her &amp; when she was going. When, however, in the evening Bapusaheb Jog proposed to go formally to Sayinsaheb for asking permission, she said she felt better &amp; did not wish to go. We wondered.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910, 11 December, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after I finished my prayer &amp; had a wash, Mr Haribhau Dixit of Bombay with a few companions, Mr Tarkhadkas son of the late Dr Atmaram Pandurang and Mr Mahajani who is a cousin of Annasaheb Mahajani of Akola. We went to Sayinsaheb as usual &amp; today&rsquo;s conversation was both important &amp; marked by two incidents. Sayin Maharaj said that he used to sit in a corner and desired to exchange the lower part of his body for that of a parrot. The exchange came &amp; he did not realize for a year and lost one lakh of rupees. Then he began to sit near a post &amp; then a great serpent woke up and was very angry. It used to jump up &amp; also fall from above. Then he changed the subject apparently &amp; said that he visited a place and the Patil there would not let him go unless he made a plantation &amp; had a foot path through it. He said he completed both. Some people came in at this point. To the man, he said, &ldquo;You were a Rohilla before &amp; were looted &amp; made later on into a Bania.&rdquo; To the woman, he said &ldquo;you have nobody but me to look after you.&rdquo; Looking round he added that she was a relation of his, &amp; had married the Rohillas who looted the man. Then he said, the world is bad. People were not as they were before. Formerly they used to be pious and trustful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they were unbelieving &amp; disposed to contemplate the evil side and then he added something which I could not catch. It was something about his father, grandfather &amp; his becoming the one &amp; the other alternatively. Now as to the incidents, Mr Dixit brought fruits. Sayinsaheb ate some &amp; was distributing the others. Balasaheb, Mamladar of this Taluk, wasthere &amp; said that Sayin Maharaj was giving away only one fruits of one kind. My son told his friend Patwardhan that Sayin Maharaj accepted or refused fruits in proportion to the devotion with which they were offered. My son Baba tried to tell this to me &amp; wished to do the same to Patwardhan. This made a little noise and Sayin Maharaj looked at me with an eye that blazed wonderfully sparkled with anger. He demanded what I said. I replied that I was saying nothing and that children were talking with each other. He looked at my son and Patwardhan and changed the mood immediately. Towards the close Balasaheb Mirikar remarked that Sayin Maharaj was talking all through to Haribhau Dixit. In the afternoon while we were at meals, Mr Mirikar &rsquo;s father who is an Inamdar &amp; a special magistrate at Ahmednagar came. He is a very respectable gentleman of the old stamp. I liked his conversation very much. In the evening we saw Sayin Saheb as usual &amp;at night we sat talking &amp; Mr. Nulkar &rsquo;s son Vishwanath did Bhajan as he does every day.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910, 12 December, Monday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after prayer we saw Sayin Maharaj passing out as usual &amp; then sat talking among ourselves as usual. Mr Dixit appears to have turned a new leaf altogether &amp; spends a good deal of his time in prayer &amp; his temper which was always mild, appears to have acquired the peculiar sweetness which is entirely due to internal calm. Rao Bahadur Rajarampant Dixit came soon after from Pulgaon. He said he had no intention of visiting Shirdi when he left Nagpur, but some how, at Pulgaon, he made up his mind to the visit very suddenly and made the journey practically on the spur of the moment. I was very glad to see him. We all went to see Sayin Saheb later on. I was a bit late &amp; missed a very interesting story told by him. He teaches in parables.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about a man having a very beautiful horse, which, do what he could, would not go in pair. It was taken all round and given all the usual training to no purpose. At last a widwan suggested its being taken to the place from which it was originally brought. This was done &amp; then the horse went all right in the harness and became very useful. I heard the fag end of the parable. Then he enquired when I was going. I replied that I would go when he gave me permission of his own accord to go. He replied &ldquo;you go today after taking your meals,&rdquo; and later on sent curds by the hand of Madhava Rao Deshpande, as prasad to me. I had it at meals, &amp; soon after it went to Sayin Saheb. He confirmed his permission to go as soon as I went. My son did not feel sure of the permission &amp; so asked expressly &amp; the permission was given in clear words. The Sayin Maharaj today asked Dakshina of others but nothing of me or my son. I was very low in funds &amp; he appeared to know it. After saying goodbye to Mr Nulkar, Mr Dixit, Mr Bapusaheb Jog, Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe, Madhavarao Deshpande, Balasaheb Bhate, Wasudeorao &amp; others we left with Patwardhan, Pradhan, Kaka Mahajani, Mr Tarkhad and Mr Bhide who came today. We caught the train about 6.30 P.M. at Kopargaon &amp; travelled to Manmad, Mr Bhide getting down at Yeola. I &amp; my son will soon leave Manmad by the Punjab Mail. Last night I dreamt that I saw Uzizuddin &amp; another whom I could not recognize.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1910, 13 December, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Manmad-Akola.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I &amp; my son Baba got into the Punjab Mail, and secured seats in a compartment with some trouble by the help of a ticket collector. There were two Gujaratis going to Akola and an aiya who was accompanying an English lady going to Calcutta side. We had to sit up all the way up to Bhusaval which we reached about midnight &amp; changed into the Nagpur passenger. We met Hiralal ticket collector there &amp; stood talking with him for a few minutes. I &amp; Baba lay down and slept up to Akola where we got down about 5 A.M. and drove to Vyankateshar Desai &rsquo;s Bungalow at Umbri. He has extended &amp;made it very comfortable. He &amp; his family, Mahipat, Narayan, &amp; children were very glad to see me. Vyankatesh Hundiwala with his uncle Yashavantrao are also here &amp; very glad to meet me. I had an early bath &amp; lay down. Vyankatesh went to the Bar dinner which was held at the Indian Club. I had a late breakfast and lay down again after it. Towards evening Bapusaheb Phadke, Hatwalne, Dada Khunzode, Gupte, Paranjape all pleaders came to see me, &amp; we all sat talking. I was very sorry to learn that Dada Soman &amp; Madhavarao Vaidya are dead. They were very old friends. Hatwalne is a new L.L.B., now practicing. He is a Jahagirdar of Lupali in Malkapur Taluk. Wapudeo Narayan Joshi who is the chief constable here came to see me &amp; enquired about the duration of my stay. It is only for a day. After they all went, I had some milk with Vyankatesh. We propose to retire early.</p>
<p id="1911" style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 11 January, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Amravati.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From today the court are closed for nearly a week on account of the Moharrum &amp; Sankrant holidays. Yesterday, Asnare, Palekar, Brahma Ganorkar &amp; others went on a tour to visit Sherdi, Kedgaon, Poona, Alandi &amp; if time permits, Bombay. This would be rather a full programme. I sent two coconuts &amp; three rupees with Palekar as a present to Sayin Maharaj of Sherdi &amp; for incidental expenses of fruits etc. Today in getting out of bed. I felt unwell, &amp; my prayers were difficult to finish. To complete them I sat in the upper hall after my morning wash. The physician who is practising here came to see me. So did Karandikar &amp; a few others. I sat on in the upper hall, for my usual office was full of Moharum Fakirs &amp; Fakirnis and Gopalrao Dole, with Godbole &amp; Durravi, sat there praying them. After the midday meal I lay down a while &amp; then felt slightly better. V.K. Kale came &amp; we sat talking about the new book &ldquo;At the feet of the Master &rdquo; by Alcyone i..e. Krishnanandi then came Kurandikar Gokhale &amp; others. About the time of their departure came Govindrao Khaparde. He is a cousin of mine, &amp; lives at Savalaperi. He sat talking. I asked him to take his evening meal here &amp; he excused himself of the ground of its being Ekadasi. He went away about 9 P.M.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 17 January, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Amravati.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had court work today so there was not much time to do any thing in the morning. After prayer I came into the hall as usual &amp; finding Baba Palekar there, sat talking with him. He visited Shirdi &amp; made my presents to Sayin Maharaj. The latter accepted them. In the course of conversation he remarked that he had not asked for sugarcanes for the last one thousand years &amp; now that he did so, only three were brought to him. What could he do with them? He permitted Palekar &amp; his companions to go away at once saying they could see God in a few days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast I went to court with Gopalrao Dole &amp;Palekar joined us on the way. I appeared before Mr Dighe &amp; presented the written statement of Motilal Champalal. Then I went to additional Session &rsquo;s Judges Court and inspected the misl of the appeal to be argued tomorrow. Gopalrao Dole and Durrani helped me. It is an appeal purely on evidence. Then we returned home &amp; I lay down for a while and wrote an English letter. Later on I sat reading. Asnari came &amp; I sat talking with him about his recent trip in company with Palekar, Brahman &amp; Ganorkar. He said the last tried to help the Palkhi at Alandi, by putting one of his shoulders to it. Then he thought he would give the other shoulder a chance &amp; made the change but found the Palkhi very heavy and tiring. So he reproached himself &amp; begged to be forgiven whereupon the Palkhi at once became light &amp; he could carry it easily. Annasaheb Patwardhan was there &amp; told the story of a Brahman who had Bramhastra taught to him by his guru.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man encroached on his land and he could get no redress though he carried the matter to the Madras High Court. So the Brahman, one day, in reciting &amp; giving oblations to the sun, by accident remembered the injustice. Therefrom the trespasser felt a burning sensation, fell ill, and reached the point of death. At last a Swami came &amp; cured him and got the Brahman to renounce the Brahmastra at the root of a Shani tree. We sat talking a long time. V.K.Kale, Godbole, Braji Gokhale &amp; others came &amp; joined the conversation. I told them about Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe&rsquo;s conviction &ldquo;inspite of himself &rdquo; as he says. He wrote to my son Baba and sent the letter with Baba Palekar who delivered it this morning. Sayin Maharaj won as he was bound to do. The case is wonderful as Babasaheb Sahasrabuddhe is a tough customer.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 21 January, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Amravati.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had court work today &amp; got up early in the morning though not feeling well. I could not sleep as usual last night. There was not time to do much in the morning. A few clients came &amp; Gopalrao Dorle read their papers. After breakfast I &amp; Dorle went to court and appeared before Mr Price, in the appeal adjourned to today. Pandit Rao Joshi appeared on the other side. The court decided to examine a witness in appeal though he was cancelled by the other side in the L.C. This is very unusual &amp; I pointed out the thing to the Court. The appeal was adjourned to 11th Feb next and I returned home, &amp; not feeling well lay down. There is a kind of lumbago in my back &amp; I felt uneasy. So I came out &amp; lay in the long chair reading. Shriram came &amp; sat talking about a matter that he was fighting in the Session &rsquo;s Court. A young man who has grown long matted hair &amp; lets them fall all round his face &amp; be something like a veil even on the eyes, came in a cart driven by himself. I noticed him near my house under one of the trees on the roadside. He drove into my compound. So I went near him &amp; saluted as he was dressed as a Sadhu in saffron robe. At my request he came &amp; sat down in my verandah. Mahadeva, who is an ex-post office officer was also present. Shriram thinks the Sadhu is a detective &amp; hinted to me accordingly. The Sadhu said that he had seen me before. I replied that I remembered nothing. He said that was true, but he remembered it. To use his expression he said &ldquo;the black dog has become white.&rdquo; He sat talking of my visit to England, then asked that I should build a small house for him near Kondeshwar &amp; I replied that I had not the means at present to comply with his request. Then he asked for Ganja .We sent for it &amp; he had a smoke. He had his bulls fed, and towards dusk went away. V.K.Kale, &amp; Karandikar came while he was sitting &amp; joined in the conversation. We sat talking after he went about Sayin Maharaj of Shrrdhi till about 8.30 P.M.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911 5 December Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Amravati -</em><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up as usual, prayed &amp; came into the hall. There were a few clients with whom I sat talking. Gokhale, Bwaji, &amp; Bhow Durrani came. I made up my mind to leave this afternoon for Shirdi &amp; told Dharwankar to make the necessary arrangements. Mandlik Shastri &amp; Haridas are sorry that I have to go but it can not be helped. After breakfast I lay down for a while &amp; then sat reading. Chitale master came. Bandu came this morning from Elichpur. I decided to take him with me. So I dressed at 4 P.M. &amp; went to the Railway station with my son Baba. With Bandu I got into the Mail. At Amravati station I met Mr Smith of the Postil Department &amp; his sister-in-law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost his wife some ten days ago. At Badmera I met Mr Bind, &amp; at Akola Mr Barr &amp; Captain Doctor. All the way up to Kopargaon I had the first class compartment all to myself. I could not sleep well in the train. At Kopargaon we got a tonga &amp; drove to Sherdi reaching it soon after day break.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 6 December, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my Tonga came near the house newly built by Mr Dixit the first person I met was Mr Madhavarao Deshpande. Before I got out of the tonga Mr Dixit asked me to dine with him today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I went with Madhavarao to pay respects to Sayin Maharaj and saluted him from a distance. He was washing hands &amp; feet at the time. As I got busy washing &amp; praying I could not salute him when he went out. Later on we went to him in company &amp; sat near him in the Masjid. He told a story about having been with a Fakir who was fond of good food. This Fakir was invited to dinner party &amp; went with Sayin Maharaj. At the time of starting the Fakir&rsquo;s wife asked Sayin Maharaj to bring some food from the feast &amp; gave a pot for the purpose. The Fakir fed so well that he decided to sleep at the place. Sayin Maharaj returned with the food tying the cakes to his back &amp; carry the liquid in the pot placed on his head. He found the way very long, lost his way sat near a Mangawada to rest a while, the dogs began to bark &amp; he got up and returned to his village &amp; made over the cakes &amp; liquid to the Fakir&rsquo;s wife. By that time, the Fakir also returned and they had a very good feed together. He added it is very difficult to find a good Fakir. Mr Sathe who built the wada in which I lived last year, is here &amp; I saw him first in the Masjid and then at dinner. Mr Dixit fed a large number. Among them is Mr Thosar who is the sister&rsquo;s son of the late Madhavarao Govind Ranade. Thosar is employed in the Custom&rsquo;s office Bombay. He is a very nice man &amp; we sat talking. There is a gentleman from Nassik &amp; there are many others. Among them one Tipnis who came with his wife &amp; the latter was brought to bed of a son. Bapusaheb Jog is here &amp; his wife is doing well. Mr Nulkar is dead &amp; I miss him very much. None of his family is here. Balasaheb Bhate is here &amp; his wife gave birth to a son on Datta jayanti day. We are staying in Dixit &rsquo;s Wada which is very convenient.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 7 December, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept well last night. My son &amp;wife are doing well with Bhishma. Vishnu is also here. We fed a good many people today &amp; I fell into the proper routine of the place. I saluted Baba Sayin Maharaj as he went out. Then after he returned to the Masjid, and again in the evening &amp; later on again when he went to sleep in the Chavadhi. The Bhajanpujana was a little less, as some fools object to music. After we returned from Sheja-Arti, Bhishma had his usual Bhajana, &amp; Mr Thosar also sang some verses, a few of his own composition &amp; others of Kabir, Das Ganu &amp; others. Das Ganu &rsquo;s wife, Bayu who was here last year, is now at her father&rsquo;s house. We sat talking till late at night. Bapusaheb jog told me in the morning, that after I went away last year, the Commissioner &amp; the Collector came to see Sayin Maharaj. He would not let them into the Masjid. They waited at the Chavadhi. Sayin Maharaj saw them as he went out &amp; looked at them through a sort of a telescope made by folding the fingers of his hand. They wished to speak with him. He asked them to wait for two hours. They did not wait, but went leaving ten Rupees for Daxina. Sayin Maharaj did not like to keep the money &amp; gave it away. Madhavarao Deshpande told us at night that Dada Kelkar had a son by name Babu. Sayin Maharaj was very kind to him. This Babu died &amp; Maharaj remembers him to this day. Mr Moreshwar Vishwanath Pradhan Barrister at Law, practising at Bombay came to see Sayin Maharaj. On seeing his wife Sayin Maharaj said that she was the mother Babu. She got in the family way later on, &amp; on the day of her delivery in Bombay, Sayin Maharaj here said he had pain, &amp; that twins would be born, &amp; that one of them would die. So it happened &amp; when Mrs Pradhan came here with her young son Sayin Maharaj took him on his lap &amp; asked if he would come to the place &amp; the child of two months distinctly answered &ldquo;How.&rdquo;<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 8 December, Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to mention yesterday &amp; the day before that Upasani Vaidya that used to be at Amravati is here &amp; saw me soon after my arrival. We sat talking. He told me briefly his story since leaving Amravati, how he went to Gwalior state, how he purchased a village, how it became non- paying, how he met a Mahatma, how he got ill, how he tried all remedies, applied to various Sadhus &amp; Mahatmas, how finally Sayin Maharaj took him in hand, how he improved &amp; is now under orders to stay here. He has composed a stotra of Sayin Maharaj in Sanskrit. We all got up early and attended the Kakad-Arti. It is very edifying. I prayed, bathed &amp; saw Sayin Maharaj go out, then again after he returned &amp; once more in the afternoon. Sayin Maharaj looking at me said &ldquo;Ka Sarkar &rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he gave the general advise that I should live as God keeps me, &amp; added that a man fond of his family has to bear many things &amp; so on &amp; told the story of a rich man who slaved till evening, cooked for himself and ate a very rough bread, all on account of a temporary difficulty. We saw Sayin Maharaj again the evening &amp; then sat in the verandah of the house built by Dixit. Two gentlemen from Bombay brought a Satar &amp; playing on it said Bhajan. Mr Thosar whom I call Hazarat also sang very beautifully and Bhishma had his usual Bhajan. Time passed very pleasantly till midnight. Thosar is a very pleasant companion. I had a long talk with my son Balvant the Bombay men &amp; others about contemplation etc. Madhavarao Deshpande was here &amp; fell asleep. I saw with my own eyes, &amp; heard with my own ears what I only read about but never experienced that with every outgoing &amp; in drawing breath of Madhavarao Deshpande comes the clear sound of &ldquo;Sayin Nath Maharaj Sayin Nath Baba &rdquo;. This sound is as clear as clear can be &amp; when Madhavrao snores, the words can be heard even at a distance. This is really wonderful &amp; he is in deep sleep all the time.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 9 December, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was late in getting up &amp; finishing my prayer. Mr Chandorkar came today with a servant. Many others also came &amp; some that were already here went away. Mr.C. is a very nice simple man, very pleasant in conversation &amp; plain in his dealings. I went to the Masjid &amp; sat long listening to things said there. Sayin Maharaj was in a pleasant mood. I took my Hukka there and Sayin Maharaj had a smoke out of it. He looked wonderfully beautiful at Arti time, but dismissed every one very soon after it. He said he would come to dine with us. He calls my wife &ldquo;Ajibai &rdquo;. On returning to our lodging we learned that Mr Dixit &rsquo;s daughter who was ill passed away. The deceased dreamt a few days ago that Sayin Maharaj kept her under the Neem tree here. Sayin Maharaj also said yesterday that the girl was dead. We sat talking about the sad event. The child was only seven years old. I went &amp; saw her mortal remains. They were very beautiful and the expression on her face, after death, was peculiarly charming. It reminded me of the pictures of Madonna that I saw in England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cremation took place behind our lodging. I attended the funeral &amp; did not break fast until 4 P.M. Dixit bore the blow wonderfully well. His wife naturally broke down under grief. Every body sympathizes with her. In the evening I went to Chavadi to see Sayin Maharaj both at sunset and later on at Shejarti time. At night I, Madhavarao Deshpande Bhishma &amp; others sat talking till late, all about Sayin Maharaj. Thosar got permission from Sayin Maharaj to return to Bombay. He will return tomorrow morning.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 10 December, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning before I finished my prayer Dattatreya Chitnis solicitor of Bombay. He was a freshman when I was a fellow in the college. So he is an old friend. We naturally sat talking of old days &amp; so on. As usual I saw Sayin Maharaj as he went out &amp; later again when he returned &amp; sat in his usual place. We all return &amp; after Arti. The breakfast was a bit late &amp; after it I sat talking with Upasani, later on with Mr Nanasaheb Chandorkar. He is the chief, if not the oldest disciple, of Sayin Maharaj. He is a very pleasant man, gave me his history as to how he came into contact with Sayin Maharaj &amp; made his progress. He wished to tell me the instructions he received, but people gathered and the thing could not be Disclosed to the view<br />of all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made two attempts to see Sayin Maharaj in the afternoon, but he was not in the mood to see any body. I saw him in the evening near the Chavadhi and had a long talk with Sathesaheb &amp; Chitnis &amp; others. There is one Gokhale come from Narisoba Wadi. He says he was directed to see Narayan Maharaj of Kedgaon and Sayin Maharaj. He sings very nicely and at night I got him to sing a few Bhajans. Mr Nanasaheb Chandorkar returned today to Thana. Balasaheb Bhate who got a son a few days ago lost him this evening. This was very sad. Sayin Maharaj this afternoon prepared some medicine which he took.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 11 December, Monday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prayer this morning was very very pleasant and after it I felt quite elevated. Then I sat explaining the first few verses of Panchadasi to Dattatreya Chitnis. He is a very nice man. Then we visited Sayin Maharaj both as he went out and after he returned. He gave me the chillam very often &amp; grapes that RadhaKrishnabai presented. He gave the grapes twice to my son Balvant. In the afternoon I heard that he was cleaning the Masjid. So I did not attempt to go that side. All the people brought a deputation to Sayin Maharaj to get rid of the plague. He advised them to clean the roads, sweep the tombs and burning &amp; burial ghats and to feed the poor. I spent the whole afternoon reading daily papers and talking to Chitnis &amp; others. Upasani is composing something. In the evening we saw Sayin Maharaj near Chavadhi &amp; again attended the Sheja- Arti, after which Chitnis his Engineer friend &amp; another went away. I intend retiring early.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 12 December, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I and Bhishma got up very early under the impression that the Kakad Arti was about to begin but we were early by about an hour. Later on Megha came and we attended the Arti. Then I prayed, &amp; sat waiting for Sayin Maharaj to go out. I saw him then &amp; again after he returned. I spent the interval in listening to the songs of Gokhale. He sings well. Today the breakfast was late as Megha could not get the leaves of Bela &amp; had to go a long distance for them. So the mid-day Puja was not finished till about 1.30 P.M. Sayin Maharaj was in very good mood &amp; sat chatting &amp; laughing. After we returned &amp; sat to our breakfast a man is said to have come to call me to the Local Durbar held here in the school. By the time I finished my meal &amp; came out ,the whole thing was over. Some poor were fed by the munificence of Nanasaheb Sathe. He left instructions for the purpose &amp; Mr H.S. Dixit took a great deal of trouble about the matter. The food could not have been very good. After breakfast I lay down for a few minutes &amp; then went with my people to the Masjid. Sayin Maharaj was in a good mood &amp; told a story. Taking up a fruit lying there, he asked me how many fruits it was capable of producing. I replied as many tens of thousands as there were seeds in it. He smiled very pleasantly &amp; added that it obeyed laws of its own. He also told how there was a girl very good and pious, how she served him &amp; prospered. We got &ldquo;Udi &rdquo; about sunset &amp; then stood opposite the Chavadhi to see Sayin Maharaj when he came out for his evening stroll. We saw him &amp; returned &amp; sat listening to the Bhajan of Bhishma, Gokhale, Bhai &amp; one young man Dixit. Madhavarao Deshpande &amp; Upasani were present. The evening passed very pleasantly.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 13 December, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual, prayed and wished to bathe but hot water was not ready. So I came out &amp; sat talking. I saluted Sayin Maharaj as he went out &amp; then had my bath. I read Panchadasi. Later on I went to see Sayin Maharaj at the Masjid and returned after Arti. About 4 P.M. I went away with Balvant, Bhishma &amp; Bauda who brought my Hukka &amp; Sayin Maharaj had a smoke out of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madhavarao asked for permission for me to return to Amravati but Sayin Maharaj said that he would decide about it tomorrow morning. He got all the people there out of the Masjid &amp; advised me very very kindly in a truly fatherly way. At sunset we went again &amp; saw him opposite the Chavadhi and later on attended the Sheja-Arti. Then Bhishma had his Panchapadi, earlier then usual. Bhai also sang a Bhajan.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 14 December, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing to go away I got up early, attended the Kakad Arati and praying somewhat in haste went to Sayin Maharaj at the Masjid with Madhavarao Deshpande. Sayin Maharaj said that I could go tomorrow or so and added that I should serve God alone &amp; no one else. He said &ldquo;What God gives is never finished &amp; what man gives never lasts .&rdquo;Then I returned, and saw Durveshasaheb Falke of Kalyan arrive. He is a very nice old gentleman of he old sort. Mr Shingne &amp; his wife are with him. Mr Shingne is a High Court Varkerl of Bombay &amp; has a law class also. He said that the partition of Bengal has been naturally modified, that Delhi has been substituted for Calcutta as capital &amp; that some prisoners have been released, but their names etc are not yet known. I attended the mid-day puja &amp; had my breakfast with Bapusaheb Jog. After it I lay down &amp; fell asleep. I went to the Masjid a little late &amp; then made my namaskar near the Chavadhi. Then I sat talking with Durveshasaheb &amp; Shingne. Later on Bhishma had his daily Bhajan.<br />G.S,Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 15 December, Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after prayer I sat talking with Mr Shingne and Mr Durvesh Falke. He is also called Hajisaheb. He has travelled to Baghadad, Constantinople and Mecca &amp; all places near about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His conversation is very pleasant &amp; instructive. Sayin Maharaj likes him very much, sends him food &amp; otherwise treats him with great consideration. I saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again at Masjid on his return. He was in a very pleasant mood &amp; we all enjoyed his conversation. After meals I lay down for a while &amp; then sat listening to an account of Delhi, read by my son Balvant. Then we went to the Masjid, received the blessings of Sayin Maharaj and later on went for Sheja-Arti.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 16 December, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find I have got a severe cold. I could not get up in time for the Kakad Arti. I got up at 3 am &amp; then overslept myself. After prayer I sat talking with Durveshasaheb Falke whom they call Hajisaheb &amp; Hajarat indiscriminately. He is a Karma Margi as we should call him in Hinduism, &amp; has numerous anecdotes to tell. I saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; later on after he returned to the Masjid. He was in a very pleasant mood &amp; sat talking &amp; joking. After Arti I returned to our lodging &amp; had food and lay down a while, but could not sleep. From Amravati they sent me, besides the Amrit Bazar Patrika, two numbers of the Bombay Advocate. So there was a good deal to read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a telegram offering a Sessions &rsquo; case. Three days ago there was a telegram offering the case at Wardha. I declined it as Sayin Maharaj did not grant permission to return. About todays telegram, the result was the same. Madhavarao Deshpande asked for permission for me &amp; Sayin Maharaj said I might go the day after or a month hence. So the matter is settled. I saluted him as usual in front of the Chavadhi &amp; after Arti in the Wada sat listening to Bhishma&rsquo;s Bhajan. My wife went to a neighbouring village Rahata in the morning for renewing the bangles on her wrist. Among the new arrivals today is Mr Hate who has appeared for LM&amp;S. He is a very nice young man. His father was judge at Avireli &amp; later on Divar of Palitonia. I think I knew he uncle. He is a goldsmith what they call Daivajna Brahman. I am feeling unwell.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 17 December, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cold is a little better this morning but not much, but my health looks worse. Mr Shingne gave me some soda &amp; acid powder and I put it in milk &amp; drank it. It relieved my bowels &amp; I felt better. My wife is confined to bed on account of pains in the back &amp; legs. After prayer I saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; then again after he returned. He was in very good mood, &amp; we enjoyed very much the jokes made by him. The breakfast was late as Megha raj had gone out to bring Bel leaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came back a little late. In the afternoon I sat talking with Hajisaheb Falke, Dr Hate, Mr Shingne &amp; others. Gokhale went away today. He has on him &amp; in his general conduct all the indications of a spy. He gave out here that he was a friend of Atre subjudge Nagpur. Towards evening I went to Masjid but Sayin Maharaj asked me &amp; my companions to bow from a distance. He however called my son Balvant near &amp;told him to bring Dakshina. We all saluted him opposite the Chavadhi &amp; again at night at Sheja-Arti. Tonight Sayin Maharaj sleeps at the Chavadhi.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 18 December, Monday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My throat is better today than it was yesterday. After prayer I sat talking with Mr Shingne, Wamanrao Patel, and Durveshisaheb whose full name would appear to be Durvish Haji Mahomed Saddik of Kalyana. I saw Sayinsaheb go out and later went to the Masjid when he returned. He said I had filled my bucket was enjoying the cool breezes of the Nim tree &amp; was enjoying myself while he was enduring all manner of trouble &amp; had no sleep. He was in a very pleased moods &amp; many people came to worship. My wife also came. We returned after mid-day Arti, and after meals, sat talking with Hajisaheb, Bapusaheb Jog &amp; others. Towards evening we went to Masjid and sat near Sayinsaheb but there was not much time as it was approaching evening. So he gave us leave, &amp; we stood in front of the Chavadhi and as usual saluted him there. Returning to our lodging I sat listening to Bhishmas &rsquo;Bhajan.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P.S.</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An employee of Central Press came today with his wife &amp; daughter. He said he had seen me before in Bombay &amp; again at the Poona Railway station when I went with all my family for the wedding of my third son. He appeared to be a very nice man &amp; devotionally inclined. He came today &amp; Sayin Maharaj gave him permission to return and he returned accordingly. Govind Rao Gandagole of Bassein came with him &amp; is naturally staying with me. He came from Akola without going to Amravati. He is alone &amp; nobody is with him.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 19 December, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early, felt fresh, prayed &amp; felt that I was better all round. Sayin Maharaj went out while I was yet praying so I could not see him. Later on I went to the Masjid &amp; found him in a very pleasant mood. He said there was a rich man who had five sons &amp; a daughter. These children effected a division of the family property. Four of the sons took their shares of movables &amp; immovables. The fifth son &amp; the daughter could not take possession of their share. They wandered about hungry, came to Sayin Baba. They had six carts laden with jewels. Robbers took away two of the six carts. The remaining four were kept under the baniyan tree. At this point Trimbakrao who Baba calls Maruti interrupted &amp; the story ran in a different channel. After the midday Arti I returned to the lodging, had food &amp; sat talking with Durveshasaheb. He is a very pleasant man. Waman Rao Patel went away today. He never so much as came to us to say &ldquo;goodbye &rdquo;. Ram Maruti Bua came in the afternoon. He danced &amp; jumped about a good deal during Bhajan. We saw Sayin Maharaj in the evening &amp; again at Sheja-Arti time. Ram Maruti Bua attended Bhishma&rsquo;s Bhajan &amp; danced &amp; jumpted. Sayin Baba this afternoon went out towards Nimgaon visited Dangale, cut a tree &amp; came back. Many went after him, with musical instruments and escorted him home. I did not go far. Radha Krishna Bai came to near our Wada to greet Sayin Saheb, &amp; I saw her for the first time without the big veil on.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 20 December, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early in the morning and went to Kakad Arti. Towards the close of the Arti I noticed Waman Rao there with surprise and learnt that he on the way near Kopargaon, sent the driver of his cart to purchase guavas &amp; the bullocks ran away. He wandered about, was taken hold of by the Police &amp; had a good deal of trouble. The story was very laughable. Sayin Maharaj left Chavadhi without any audible remark except that Allah is the lord of all. I returned to our lodging, prayed, &amp; saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again on his return to Masjid. He was in a very pleased mood. Durveshasaheb told me that Sayin Baba saw him at night &amp; granted his wish. I mentioned this to Sayin Maharaj and he said nothing. I today Champooed the legs of Sain Maharaj. The softness of his limbs is wonderful. Our meal was somewhat late. After it I sat reading the papers received today. There are letters from Miss Campbell &amp; Miss Willis. Towards evening I went to Masjid, received Sayin Baba&rsquo;s blessing, saluted him in front of Chavadhi and returned to my lodging. We had Bhishmas Bhajan attended by Ram Maruti Baba &amp; Ramayan read by Dixit.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 21 December, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual, prayed ,and sat talking with Durveshisaheb. He said he had a vision in which he saw three girls and a blind woman knock at his door. He asked them who they were &amp; they replied that they had come to amuse themselves. Therefore he ordered them out on pain of being kicked and began a prayer. The girls &amp; the old woman ran away on hearing the words of the prayer. He then blessed all in the room &amp; in the house and the whole village. He asked me to ask Sayin Saheb. When I went to see the latter on his return to the Masjid, &amp; before I was fairly seated, Sayin Saheb commenced a story. He said he was bitten last night by something on his private parts and hands that he applied oil wandered about, had a stool &amp; then felt better near the fire. I champooed his legs &amp; on my return told the story to Durveshasaheb. The answer was clear. After the midday Arti, I sat reading Bhavirtra Ramayan &amp; then later on saw Sayin Saheb near the Chavadhi, &amp; later on again at Sheja-Arti at Chavadhi. Then we had Bhishmas Bhajan and Rama Maruti &rsquo;s gesticulations. Later still Mr Dixit read Ramayana.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 22 December, Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning to go to Kakad Arti, but in consequence of a remark made by Madhavarao Deshpande, I thought of not going but later on Madhavarao himself went &amp; I accompanied him. Sayin Maharaj was particularly pleasant looking &amp; went quietly to Masjid. We all saluted him when he went out &amp; again after he returned to the Masjid. Shigne and Darveshasaheb made an attempt to go today but Sayin Maharaj did not grant them the necessary permission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darvesh Saheb got ill &amp; had fever. Dr Hate treated him. I think I have mentioned before that there is one Tipnis staying here with his wife. She is ill &amp; Dr Hate has been doing all he can for her. Ram Maruti Maharaj is also here for her. She had a fit in the evening, but it turned out to be an obsession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dixit, Madhavarao Deshpande &amp; others went to see her. She is possessed by the owner of the house in which she lives by two Mahars. The owner declared that he would have killed her but that Sayin Baba ordered him not to. The Mahars are also kept away by Sayin Baba. When Tipnis threatened to move his wife to this wada the spirits prayed earnestly &amp; asked him not to do so. The spirits said Sayin Baba would beat them. There was Bhishma's Bhajan as usual &amp; later on Ramayan by Dixit a little before midnight.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 23 December, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early enough in the morning but fell asleep again &amp; then got up very late. In coming down I found that Shingne ,his wife &amp; Durveshasaheb had obtained their permission to return to their homes. So they left, the former to Bombay &amp; the latter to Kalyan. Durveshasaheb is obviously very much advanced spiritually as Sayin Maharaj came as far as the breach in the wall to see him off. I miss him very much as we used to have long talks. Mr Maruti Solicitor of Bombay; came yesterday with his family, four brothers &amp; a number of children. He is a very nice man &amp; we sat talking. Mr Mahajani whom I met last year came today &amp; brought very good fruit and globes of glass for Sayin Baba &rsquo;s lamps. Mr Govarthandas of Thana is also here. He brought very good fruit, silk curtains for Sayin Maharajas improvised room in the Chavadhi &amp; new dresses for volunteers who carry the umbrella, chamars &amp; fans. He is said to be a very rich man. There was a little meaningless disagreement between Madhavarao Deshpande &amp; my wife &amp; my son, about living in Dixits Wada. Sayin Baba said that the wada belonged to himself &amp; neither to Dixit nor to Madhavarao. So the matter settled itself. I could not see Sayin Maharaj go out but paid my respects on his return to Masjid. He gave me fruit &amp; smoke out of his chillam. In the afternoon I had a little sleep after meals &amp; then sat reading the daily papers received today. Tilak &rsquo;s release is mentioned as settled but there are no indications of it yet. The new arrivals from Bombay can give no further news. Waman Rao Patel has passed his LL.B. I heard Dr Hate had passed also. Sayin Maharaj says he will get very good news. Tipnis has changed his lodgings &amp; his wife is better. She is not so restless as she used to be. Ram Marutibuva is still here. We went to Sheja Arti. The procession was very impressive and the new curtains &amp; dresses looked very nice. I enjoyed it very much. What a pity I have it not in my power to make rich presents of the kind. God is great. At night Bhishma had his Bhajan &amp; Dixit read Ramayan.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 24 December, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early and went to the Kakad Arti. On my return I prayed and walked about. Mr Maruti got permission to return So he went away with all his family after saying good bye to nearly every one. He is a very very good man. Wamanrao Patel also went. Then came a large number of visitors. Among them was a lady by name Annsuyabai. She appeared to be spiritually advanced and Sayin Maharaj treated her with great consideration and gave her four fruits. Later on he told the story of a man having five sons. Four of them demanded &amp; obtained partition. Two of these four decided to reunite with the father. The latter ordered the mother to poison one of these two &amp; she obeyed. The other fell from a tall tree, got injured, &amp; was on the point of death but was allowed by the father to survive about twelve years until a son &amp; a daughter were born to him &amp; then he died. Sayin Baba said nothing about the fifth son &amp; to me the story looks incomplete. After the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp; then sat reading the Ramayana. The mail arrived &amp; I had a good read out of the dailies. In the evening we went as usual to Salute the Sayin Saheb oppose the Chavadhi, and at night had Bhishmas Bhajan and Dixits Ramayan. Dr Hate is still here &amp; is a very very nice man. Mr Mahajani is also here.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 25 December, Monday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after prayer I saw Sayin Maharaj go out, &amp; sat talking with Mr Mahajani &amp; others. Many guests came &amp;many more came, and things are wearing a rather busy appearance. Mr Govarthandas gave a dinner and invited nearly every one here who has come to see Sayin Maharaj.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son Balvant had a dream last night in which he thought he saw Sayin Maharaj &amp; Mrs Bapusaheb Jog in our Elichpur house. He offered food to Sayin Baba. He told me about the dream &amp; I thought it was a mere fancy, but today he called Balvant &amp; said &ldquo;I went to your house yesterday &amp; you fed me but gave no Dakshina. You should give twenty-five Rupees now.&rdquo; So Balvant returned to the lodgings and went with Madhavarao Deshpande and paid the Dakshina. At midday Arti, Sayin Maharaj gave me prasad of Peda, fruits, &amp; made a distinct sign to me to make a bow. I at once prostrated myself. He had some confidential talk with Madhavarao Deshpande. The latter has promised to tell me all about it. Today the breakfast was very late, &amp; was not over till 4 P.M. I had it with Govarthandas, or rather at the Mandap near our lodging spread at his expense. After it I felt very lazy &amp; sat talking. We all saw Sayin Maharaj in the evening both before he came out as usual for his stroll &amp; then again when he was taken in Bhajan procession to Chavadhi. Kondaji Fakir lost his daughter tonight. She was interred near our lodging. Bhishma had his Bhajan &amp; Dixit read Ramayan.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 26 December, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early &amp; attended the Kakad-Arti. Sayin Maharaj was in rather an unusual mood; took his stick &amp; with it tapped the ground round about. By the time he descended the steps of the Chavadhi, he walked twice backward &amp; forward &amp; used violent language. In my return I prayed, bathed &amp; sat in the verandah in front of my room. I saw Sayin Maharaj go out. The Injadars of Kalyan &amp; Poona are here. I am afraid Mungi hunts with them. He is at any rate very familiar. Mungi whom I met here last year, came last night &amp; tried to put up with me. I would not let him. He then put his coat in my room, but with the help of Rama Maruti, I told him to take it away &amp; he did so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gokhale pleader of Poona came. He had seen my wife at Shegaon before when Ganpat Baba was working in the physical world. There was with him a seller of Indian toys &amp; another. They saw me after the mid-day Arti &amp; after I had taken my meals. I lay down for a while in the third quarter of the day and then sat talking with Mahajani, Dr Hate &amp; others. We saw Sayin Maharaj in the afternoon at the Chavadhi &amp; later on about dusk when he came out for his stroll. He was very gracious. Today he spoke with my son Balvant &amp; got him to sit, even after he told every body else to clear out. He told him not to admit any guests in the evening &amp; to take care of him &amp; that in return he (Sayin Baba) would take care of him. Madhavarao Deshpande is ill. He has caught cold and is lying down a good if not actually confined to bed. In the evening there was Bhishma's Bhajan as usual &amp; Dixits&rsquo; Ramayan afterwards. Mr Bhate was there to hear the Purana. We began the Sundar-Kand today.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 27 December, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not sleep well last night but got up early in the morning prayed, bathed and dressed earlier than usual. The detectives here appeared to be more active than usual today. One stationed himself near Sayin Maharaj. Another followed me. To test him I went to Tipnis&rsquo; house to see his wife. The detective of Kalyan followed me there and returned with me when I returned. The chief constable of Kopargaon came with a head constable &amp; took his seat in my room. My son Balvant happened to be there but there was no conversation between them. Later on they with-drew without doing anything, but they had a long consultation in front of Dixit&rsquo;s Wada. I wonder what the whole fuss was about. Mungi was much with them. After the midday Arti, I had my breakfast about 3 P.M. &amp; then lay down &amp; had a good sleep. In the afternoon many people attempted to go &amp; see Sayin Maharaj but he was not inclined to speak and dismissed them soon. So I did not go &amp; sat reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all saw him at dusk when he came out for his stroll &amp; again at Shej-Arti. Bhishma&rsquo;s Bhajan was very much prolonged today by many people singing at it. A young Mahomedan surprized me by his song. Then there was Ramayan by Dixit.<br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 28 December, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after I prayed Dr Hate &amp; Mr R.D.Moregankar got permission to return. So they went away &amp; immediately after came Nanasaheb Chandorkar, C.V.Vaidya and Mr Natekar &ldquo;Hamsa &rdquo;. I sat long speaking with the last &amp; then went &amp; saw the former two who are staying in a tent close by. Hamsa has travelled long in Himalaya, is an initiate and an accepted disciple. His conversation is therefore very edyfying. C.V.Vaidya has some trouble in one of his eyes. It is very red. Mr Chandorkar is very jolly as usual. We attended the mid- day Arti. Trimbakrao known as Maruti is very angry. He did not attend the worship today and was very sulky. Madhavarao Deshpande is better today. He was on his legs nearly the whole day. Dixit is very assiduous in attending to all guests who are very numerous. Mr Chandorkar went to Kalyan today &amp; said he would return on Sunday next. I sat talking with Hamsa in the afternoon, nearly up to the time of going to see Sayin Maharaj as he goes out for his stroll. He did not permit any body to sit there today but dismissed every one with &ldquo;Udi &rdquo;. Hamsa went to Radha Krishna &amp; spent the evening there. She sings well &amp; does Bhajan very excellant. We had Bhishma&rsquo;s Bhajan in which many joined and then there was Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan. The Sub- Inspector of Kalyan went away today &amp; in going saluted me very humbly which is rather strange. Mungi is still here wandering about among people. Dada Gole has come here from Morvi. One of my clients, Ramrao is also here. He wishes me to write an appeal. There is no time for it.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 29 December, Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a little late in getting up &amp; then sat talking with Mr Natekar whom we call &ldquo;Hamsa&rdquo; &amp; also Swami. I could not finish my prayer etc in time to go and see Sayin Maharaj as he went out. I saw him when he returned to Masjid. Hamsa was with me. Sayin Maharaj was in very good mood &amp; began a story which was very very instructive but unfortunately Trimbakrao whom we call Maruti interrupted most foolishly and Sayin Maharaj changed the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said there was a young man very hungry and wanting in almost every respect. The young man after wandering about went to Sayin Saheb&rsquo;s father&rsquo; house &amp; was received very kindly &amp; given every thing he required. The boy spent sometime there, felt fat, collected a few things, stole ornaments &amp; making the whole into a bundle wished to return to where he had come from. He was really born in &amp; belonged to Sayin Saheb&rsquo;s fathers&rsquo; house but did not know it. The boy put the bundle into the corner of a street but was seen before he could actually start. So he had to delay. In the meantime thieves took away the ornaments from his bundle. He missed them when he was on the point of starting. So he kept at the house &amp; collected more ornaments and actually started but people on the way arrested him on the suspicion of his having come by the things by theft. At this point the story got diverted, and ended abruptly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my return from the mid-day Arti I requested &ldquo;Hamsa &rdquo; to take his food with me &amp; he kindly accepted my invitation. He is a very nice simple man &amp; after meals he told us about his travels in the Himalayas, how he crested Manasa Sarowar, how he heard an Upanishad being sung there, how he followed foot prints, how he reached a cave, saw a Mahatma, and the latter spoke of the conviction of Tilak that day at Bombay, how the Mahatma introduced him to his brother (elder fellow student) how he finally met his Guru and became &ldquo;Kritastha &rdquo;. Later on we went to Sayin Baba &amp; saw him at the Masjid. He sent me a word this afternoon that I have to stay here another two months. He confirmed the message in the afternoon &amp; then said that his &ldquo;Udi &rdquo; had great spiritual properties. He told my wife that the Governor came with a lance, that Sayin Maharaj had a tusall with him &amp; drove him out, &amp; that he finally conciliated the Governor. The language is highly figurative &amp; therefore difficult to interpret. In the evening we attended the Shejarti &amp; then had the Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Ramayan of Dixit.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Hamsa</em> &rdquo; had told all this to me also when he was our guest.. It turned out to be lie afterwards. He had never been to Manas in Himalayas. Acquired a reputation of being a bad character. Gajanan Purohit was his accomplice. Both suspected to be police spies.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 30 December, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning after prayer, I wrote two letters one to my son Baba &amp; the other to Bhau Durrani telling them that I am not likely to return for another two months. Mr Natekar went to Rada Krishna lady. She, it would appear was away. He sat there &amp; felt so calm &amp; nice that he spent the whole day there. I read Ramayan in the morning, and heard Bhagavat in the afternoon, and went to Sayin Maharaj a little before dusk. He treated me very kindly, called me by name &amp; told a small tale calculated to impress the virtue of patience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he went to Aurangabad on one of his wanderings &amp; saw a Fakir sitting in a Masjid near which there was a very tall Tamarind tree. The Fakir would not let him enter the Masjid first but ultimately consented to his putting up in it. The Fakir depended entirely on a piece of cake that an old woman used to supply him at midday. Sayin Maharaj volunteered to beg for him and kept him supplied amply with food for twelve years and then thought of leaving the place. The old Fakir shed tears at parting &amp; had to be consoled with soft words. Sayin Maharaj visited him four years later &amp; found him there doing well. The Fakir then came here a few years ago &amp; lodged at the Chavadhi. Motha-Baba Fakir looked after him. From what was said I gathered that Sayin Baba stayed twelve years to instruct the Aurangabad Fakir and set him up fully in the spiritual world. At night there was Bhishmas &rsquo; Bhajan &amp;Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan. Natekar who came then also read a chapter.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1911, 31 December, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early in the morning, prayed &amp; was walking in the verandah when Hamsa came downstairs &amp; said that he could not sleep well &amp; so wandered out &amp; went to Khandoba Temple then to the house occupied at present by RadhaKrishna Bai in the hope of hearing her pray but found that there were no signs of anybody staying in the house. So he wandered about the village gate. Later on he went again &amp; met Radha Krishna Bai. She kindly helped him so he bathed, prayed and had breakfast out of the Prasad sent to her by Sayin Maharaj. I stood talking with him. He went to Radha Krishna Bai again to say goodbye and she gave him a dhoti &amp; a shirt as Prasad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he returned to Bombay with the three young men that were with him. The name of one of them was Rege. All this made me late for everything &amp; was further delayed by the Barber. I saw Sayin Baba go out but he did not permit any body to approach him &amp; salute at close quarters. I went to the Masjid later on &amp; sat there to attend the midday worship. During the Arti all the males had to stand today below the platform in the open, leaving the whole Masjid for the ladies. The arrangement was very good. On my return, I sat talking with the Mamledar of Kopargaon who happened to be here. Later on came Mr Deva Mamledar of Dahanu. Nanasaheb Chandorkar came before Arti. Our breakfast was as usual about 2 P.M. After it I sat reading the newspapers received today. The Conventionist Congress does not appear to have been an unqualified success. Towards evening I went to the Masjid but Sayin Maharaj gave &ldquo;Udi &rdquo; soon.. So I sat on the plinth of the new building, talking with the Gujarathi Shastri who is with Govardhandas. We saluted Sayin Maharaj when he came out for his usual stroll &amp; again at Sheja-Arti. Then we had the Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Dixit&rsquo; Ramayan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="1912" style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 1 January, Monday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning went to the Chavadhi for Kakad Arti. I saw Sayin Maharaja&rsquo;s face as the first thing and it was full of sweet grace I was very much delighted. After we returned to the Wada, I saw Upasani &rsquo;s brother. He has come from Dhulia. I saw him at Poona &amp; Amravati before. He went to see Sayin Maharaj &amp; was told about people bringing ties with them from a former birth &amp; meeting now in consequence of them. He told the story of a former birth in which he, Bapusaheb Jog, Dada Kelkar, Madhavarao Deshpande, myself &amp; Dixit were associated and lived in a blind alley. There was his Murushad there. He has now brought us together again. I saw him go out &amp; then sat reading Ramayan. I saw him again at mid-day Arti, &amp; he was very kind to me. Dixit gave a &ldquo;Naivedya &rdquo; today &amp; we had all our meals with him. I sat with Vaidya, Nanasaheb Chandorkhar, Mr Deva Mamledar of Dahanu, &amp; others. I sat reading again &amp; then went to see Sayin Saheb at the Masjid. He first dismissed me along with the rest but called me again saying that I was anxious to run away. In the evening we saw him opposite the chavadhi &amp; had at night the Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Dixits Ramayana. Bala Shimpi came to the Bhajan.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 2 January, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early in the morning. Upasani&rsquo;s brother who came yesterday went away before day break. After I finished my prayer Kaka Mahajani, Atr&eacute; &amp; others went. More went later on. C.V. Vaidya went after midday Arti, with three other gentlemen Nanasaheb Chandorkar held a Dhanurmas, and all were invited. After meals it was that C.V.Vaidya went. Mankar, Mamledar of Kopargaon &amp; Deva, Mamledar of Dahanu, also went then. Later on after sunset Nanasaheb Chandorkhar went with all his family. So the wada, which during these few days used to look full &amp; very pleasant is comparatively empty now &amp; we miss company. We saw Sayin Maharaj when he came out for a stroll, &amp; again at Sheja-Arti. My son Baba &amp; Gopalrao Dole came this morning to take me to Amravati. I said my departure depended on the permission of Sayin Maharaj. They saw Sayin Maharaj &amp; said there was no difficulty about the permission. Bhishma is not well today So there was no Bhajan. Ram Maruti wished to go away today but Sayin Baba detained him. There was Ramayan &amp; Bhagavat read at night.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 3 January, Wednesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early, attended the Kakad Arti and finished my prayer. My son Baba &amp; Gopalrao Dole went to Sayin Maharaj &amp; asked for permission to return to Amravati. Sayin Maharaj replied that all my return. So my son Baba &amp; Gopalrao Dole returned in great joy. They told me So I went with Madhavarao Deshpande &amp; Sayin Maharaj confirmed the permission but as we were returning he overtook us near the Khind Khind &amp; said that we may start tomorrow. I saw him when he was going out &amp; again after he returned to the Masjid. Madhavarao started the subject about my departure &amp; Sayin Maharaj replied that I had my houses both here &amp; at Amravati &amp; I may stay where I like and I may never return to Amravati. That settled the matter, so it appeared to me &amp; I told my son Baba &amp; Gopalrao Dole to return to Amravati. So they made ready &amp; went to say &ldquo;goodbye &rdquo; &amp; receive the blessing of Sayin Maharaj when the latter told them to go tomorrow. In the afternoon he said he would give all of my family, permission to return tomorrow. Megha fed some Brahmans today in completion of his Anushtana of Gayatri Purashchamena. We had our meals with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meal was served in Sathe&rsquo;s Wada. In the afternoon I saw Sayin Maharaj, both at the Masjid &amp; when he came out for his usual stroll. He was in a very pleased mood and laughed &amp; abused in one &amp; the same breath. At night there was the Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan of which two chapters were read .Tatya Patel &rsquo;s father died in the evening.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 4 January, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, prayed, and wished my son Baba &amp; Gopalrao Dole to go to Sayin Maharaj and obtain permission to return to Amravati but my wife intervened saying it was Pausha Paurnima &amp; therefore a day sacred to our family deity. So no endeavour was made to obtain the permission required. I saw him go out as usual, &amp; went to the Masjid after he returned, spending the interval in read Ramayana. We returned after the mid-day Arti, and after meals I sat talking with Bapusaheb Jog &amp; then resumed Ramayan. After 5 P.M. I went to Sayin Maharaj in the Masjid and found him walking about in the compound. My wife also came there. After a time he took his usual seat &amp; we sat near him. Dixit and his wife also came. Sayin Maharaj then told a story. He said there was a Princess living in a palace. A &ldquo;Mang &rdquo; sought shelter with her. Her sister-in-law who was there also, refused it to the Mang. So the Mang with his wife was returning disconsolate to his village when he met Alla-mirya on the way and told his story, how, stricken with poverty he sought shelter &amp; was refused. Alla-mirya advised him to return with his wife &amp; seek shelter once more with the same princess. He did so &amp; was admitted &amp; treated like a member of the family. The Mang stayed enjoying all the comforts for over six months and then coveting gold, murdered the princess with an axe. The people round about assembled in large numbers &amp; held a panchayat. The Mang admitted the offence. When the matter went to the King in due course, Alla mirya advised him to let the Mang go. The King obeyed. The princess murdered by the Mang came to be born of him as his daughter, &amp; he came once more to the palace and was permitted to stay there in affluence &amp; ease for twelve years. Then Alla-mirya inclined the King to avenge the murdered princess and the Mang was killed in the same way in which he had killed the princess. The Mang&rsquo;s widow returned to her village, accepting the Mang &rsquo;s fate as just. The princess who was born as daughter to the Mang, came to the place, took possession of what belonged to her in the former reincarnation and lived happily afterwards. Thus was the work of God done and His justice vindicated. There was Sheja- Arti at night, then Bhishmas Bhajan &amp; Dixits Ramayan. Ram Maruti today embraced Sayin Maharaj when the latter was going in procession to the Chavadhi for the Sheja-Artil<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 5 January, Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early though I did not sleep well at night. I attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Maharaj was in a pleased mood. My son Baba &amp; Gopalrao Dole went to him. On seeing them he said &ldquo;go &rdquo;.Taking this as permission to return they hired Baba Bhau &rsquo;s Tonga and went away. I prayed and saw Sayin Maharaj go out, &amp; again after he returned. He was in very good mood. Many people came. After the mid-day arti, &amp; after the usual meal, I lay down for a while and then sat listening to Ramayan read by Dixit. Upasani Bhishma &amp; Madhavarao were also present. Then about 5 P.M. I went to see Sayin Maharaj with Bhishma &amp; my son Balvant. He told how he was not well and humorously discribed his ailments. Balabhau Joshi brought parched gram. Sayin Maharaj ate a few and distributed the rest. Then we stood near the Chavadhi when he came out for his stroll, &amp; then we had the usual arti in the wada Bhishma &rsquo;s Bhajan &amp; Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan of which two chapters were read. Today some people from Dhulia came &amp;went. The forna forna with the ailing girl got permission to return today.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 6 January, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up in the morning a little before day break and finished my prayer as usual, &amp; saw Sayin Maharaj go out. After he passed on I went to Balasaheb Bhate and borrowed from him his copy of Ranganath Swami &rsquo;s Yogavashishta in Marathi, returned to my lodging, but resumed the reading of Ramayan. We all then attended the midday arti and had our meals as usual. I did not wish to lie down, but somehow sleep overcame me &amp; I slept for hours nearly. Then Dixit read Ramayan &amp; later on I went to the Masjid &amp; saw Sayin Maharaj. He was in a pleased mood &amp; there was talk. In the evening there was the usual Wada Arti &amp; later on we attended the Sheja-Arti at the Chavadhi. Sayin Maharaj was in an exceptionally pleased mood made mystic signs to Megha and did what are known as &ldquo;Drishtipata &rdquo; in yog. An astrologer has come from Dhulia and is a guest of Upasani &amp; is staying in the Wada. At night there Bhishmas Bhajan &amp; the Ramayan of Dixit.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, 7 January, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early and attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Maharaj looked exceedingly pleased and gave yogic glances. I passed the whole day in a sort of ecstasy. After morning, I, Bapusaheb Jog &amp; Upasani commenced Ranganath Yogavashishta. Then we saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; in the interval sat talking with the young Mohamedans that come to the Masjid. One of them recited some verses. The mid-day Arti was late. Sayin Baba commenced a very good tale. He said he had a very good well. The water in it was sky blue and its supply was inexhaustible. Four motas would not empty it, and the fruit grown with the water was inordinately He did not continue the story beyond the point. In the afternoon Dixit read two chapters of Ramayana. Upasani, myself, Ram Maruti and Dixit were present. Then we went to Sayin Baba &amp; attended his stroll. As it was getting dark, he got or rather showed as if, he got angry with the wood-cutter women. At night there was Bhishmas Bhajan &amp; Dixits Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P.S.</strong> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received today a letter which bears all the indications of it being written by a detective. It speaks about the release of Tilak &amp; has what appears to be a bogus enclosure. A Parsi gentleman came here today with his ladies &amp; intends going away tomorrow.. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 8 January, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning and feeling it too early, went again to sleep and then overslept my usual moment of leaving bed. So things got set forward and in that way affected the routine of the whole day. After prayer I sat reading Yogavashishta of Ranganath with Bapusaheb Jog, Upasani, Rama Maruti &amp; Madhavarao Deshpande. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp;again saw him after he returned. During the mid-day service, after the arti Sayin Maharaj exhibited sudden &amp; great anger and abused violently. It appears, as if, Plague is likely to reappear here &amp; Sayin Maharaj is endeavouring to prevent its reappearance. After meals, we sat talking. I read a little of Ramayana &amp; then arrived Mr San&eacute; Mamaledar of Kopargaon with Mr Joshi who is a Deputy Collector of Dhulia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, we went to Sayin Maharaj after reading a chapter of Ramayana. We waited there long enough to see him at &amp; after his usual stroll, &amp; then attended the Sheja Arti. At night there was the usual Bhajan &amp; Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 9 January, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, attended the Kakad Arti and after finishing the prayer had my bath. Then with Bapusaheb Jog, Upasani &amp; Rama Maruti, read Yogavashishta. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; then again after he returned to Masjid. There was a gentleman named Pimple from Amalved with a companion. After the midday arti, we had our meals &amp; I sat reading the letters received by today &rsquo;s mail. There are also three newspapers. So there was a good deal to read. Dixit read the Ramayana about 5 P.M. &amp; later on we went to the Masjid and saluted him when he came out for his stroll. At night there was the usual Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Dixits Ramayan. G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 10 January, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early in the morning and finished my prayer &amp;all before day break. Then I Upasani, Bhishma &amp; Bapusaheb Jog read Ranganathi Yogavashistha and later on I went to see Sayin Maharaj both when he went out &amp;after he returned to the Masjid. A Marwadi came there &amp; told his dream. He said he received a lot of silver &amp; finally got bars of gold &amp; woke up while he was in the act of counting them. Sayin Saheb that the dream indicated the death of some great man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt very sleepy while I was at the Masjid. I tried my utmost to keep awake but not withstanding all my efforts, my eyes kept closing every few minutes. I returned to my lodging after the mid-day arti &amp; after food lay down for some time. Then Mr Dixit read Ramayana &amp; we sat listening. In the evening we went to the Masjid to see Sayin Saheb stroll out as usual &amp; later on we attended the Sheja-Arti. Bhat&eacute;, &amp; Balakram were both absent. So the duty of holding the pea-cock fan (morchal) fell to me &amp; I enjoyed holding it very much. At night there was the usual Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Ramayana of Dixit. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 11 January, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early, prayed &amp; attended the Kakad Arti. At the usual time I Upasani &amp; BapuSaheb Jog read Yogavashishtha of Ranganath We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned. He was in very good mood &amp; every thing passed off in good style. After the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp; then Dixit read Ramayan. He also read a guor strotra guor strotra by Eknath. Towards evening we went as usual to see Sayin Maharaj come out for his stroll. He did so. Radha Krishna Bai had set up the phonograph. On hearing its noise Sayin Magaraj got very angry &amp; used hard words &amp; we returned thinking. At night there was the usual Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Dixits Puran. There was Rahata Bazar today &amp; Bandu went to it but could purchase nothing beyond vegetables. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 ,12 January, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, said my prayers ,and began the usual routine of the day when Narayan Rao &rsquo;s son Gondya &amp; brother Bhausaheb came. They arrived at Amravati from Hoshangabad sometime ago &amp; not finding me &amp; my wife there, came here to see us. We were naturally very glad to see each other &amp; sat talking. We began our Yogavashistha somewhat late as Bapusaheb Jog was away. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned to Masjid. He was very gracious &amp; repeatedly gave me smoke out of his pipe. It solved many of my doubts, and I felt delighted. After the midday arti we had our meals &amp; I had a few minutes rest. Dixit was delayed longer than usual at the Masjid. So we began Ramayan later than usual &amp; we could not finish a chapter as it was both long &amp; difficult. Then we saw Sayin Maharaj at the Masjid. He had music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two dancing girls we sang &amp; danced. Later on there were the Sheja-Arti. Sayin Maharaj was very kind to Balvant, sent for him &amp; let him spend the whole of the afternoon with him. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 13 January, Saturday</strong> <br /><strong>Shirdi</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning &amp;attended the Kakad. Sayin Maharaj did not say a word today &amp; did not even throw the glances which he usually does. The Tahasildar of Khandwa has come here. We saw him when we were reading Ranganathi Yogavashistha. The book does not appear to sustain the impression it makes at first. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out and again he returned. Yesterdays singing women were there. They sang a bit got sweets-meats for their reward and then went away. The midday arti passed very pleasantly. Megha is not yet quite well. Bapaji brother of Madhavarao Deshpande was invited to breakfast with his wife. The Tahasildar of Khandwa appears to be a cultured man, has read Yogavashishta. He says he has been brought to grief by designing persons for his devotional tendencies. After a little afternoon rest, Dixit read Bhavarth Ramayan. The chapter is a summary of Yogavashistha and is very interesting. We saw Sayin Maharaj again as he strolled out. His mood was changed and one would think that he was angry which he really was not. At night there was Bhajan &amp; Ramayan as usual. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 14 January, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning finished my prayer &amp; sat to read Ranganathi Yogavashistha with Bapusaheb Jog, Upasani &amp; Ram Maruti. We continued it after seeing Sayin Baba go out. I went to the Masjid after he returned &amp; found that he was arranging for a bath. So I returned and wrote two letters &amp; went again. He was very kind to me &amp; gave Tilgal brought for him by Bapusaheb Jog. He gave it to Balvant also. The midday arti was a little late as Megha is not well and it being Til Sankranti the Parosas were late. By the time &amp; we returned and had our midday meal it was 4 P.M. Then Dixit read Ramayan, but we did not make much progress. In the afternoon when I went Sayin Baba did not admit any body so I took a turn by Bapusaheb Jog &rsquo;s quarters and went in time for evening namaskar. The Tahasildar of Khandwa is still here &amp; gradually falling into the routine of the place. One Mr Gupte has come with his brother &amp; family. He says he is distantly related to my friend Baba Gupte of Thana. I sat talking with him. In the evening there was Sheja Arti, Bhishma &rsquo;s Bhajan and Dixits Ramayana. We all celebrated the Sankranti on a small scale. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 15 January, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning prayed and attended the Kakad arti which was a little later than usual as Megha having been unwell could not get up in time to blow the conch-shell. Sayin Maharaj did not say a word as he got up &amp; left the Chavadhi. The Tilgul of which I ate a little yesterday appears to have affected me injuriously. Upasani Shastri &amp; Bapusaheb Jog did not come soon. So I sat writing letters. When Sayin Maharaj went out he asked me how I spent the morning, which was a mild rebuke for not having read &amp; contemplated. I went to see him again when he returned &amp; he was very kind. He commenced a long story and kept on as if speaking to me, but I felt sleepy all the time &amp; did not understand any thing of the story. I was told afterwards that the story was a very thinly veiled recital of the events that actually happened in the life of Gupte. So he said. The mid-day arti was late and it was 3 P.M. by the time we returned and had our meals. I lay down a bit &amp; then attended Dixits Puran. Later on we went to the Masjid but were told to salute from a distance, which we accordingly did. Sayin Baba came for his stroll &amp; we saluted as usual. Dixit had an illumination of Masjid yesterday &amp; repeated it today also. At night there was the usual Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Purana of Dixit. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 16 January, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up as usual, prayed and commenced the daily routine with Puranamrit. It is a very celebrated Marathi work on Vedanta. Upasani reads I, Bapusaheb Jog, Bhishma &amp; Rama Maruti listen. It is exceedingly nice and I give explanations whenever necessary. I was able to see Sayin Maharaj go out but was late in going to see him after he returned to Masjid. He not only showed no displeasure but treated me with positive kindness &amp; I sat serving. The Midday Arti was late as Megha is ill &amp; was not ordered to come soon. He did so at last, and by the time we returned and had our meals, it was nearly 4 P.M. Dixit read a little of Ramayana, &amp; then we went to see Sayin Saheb at the Masjid. He did not permit us to sit long &amp; came out himself, and finished his usual stroll in a hurry and ordered us to return to the Wada. We could not understand it but on returning to the Wada learnt that Hari, a servant of Dixit, who felt indisposed the other day, died.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sent for Upasani who understands medicine but he could not be found. That the man was dead, there could be no doubt about. We did the usual arti in the Wada, &amp; attended the Sheja- Arti. Sayin Maharaj was particularly gracious at the latter and sent out wonderful currents of joy &amp; instruction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He favoured Rama Maruti similarly. We returned very much pleased and then a little before mid-night, could perform the obsequies of the servant Hari. It was difficult to procure fuel. Bapaji managed it some how &amp; then the body was cremated. The thing would not have been so difficult had Madhavarao Deshpande been here, but he went to Nagar in the afternoon to fetch his wife &amp; children. The funeral took a long time. We could neither have the usual Bhajan of Bhishma ,not the Puran of Dixit. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 17 January, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early saw Bapusaheb Jog go out to bathe. I finished my prayers in the meantime. Then we went to the Chavadhi for Kakad Arti. Megha was too ill to attend. So Bapusaheb Jog did the arti. Sayin Baba showed his face &amp; smiled most benignly. It is worth while spending years here to see it even once. I was overjoyed &amp; stood gazing like mad. After we returned Narayan Rao&rsquo;s son Govinda &amp; brother Bhau went by a cart to Kopargaon en route to Hoshanjabad, and I commenced my daily routine. I wrote a few lines &amp; then read Paramamrit with Upasani &amp; Bapusaheb Jog. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned to Masjid. He gave me silent instructions but like a fool I did not understand them. On returning to the Wada, I felt disconsolate &amp; melancholy without cause. Balvant also felt sad &amp; said that he wished to leave Shirdi. I asked him to ask Sayin Baba &amp; then decide. I lay down for a while after meals &amp; then wished to listen to Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan but Sayin Baba sent for him &amp;he had to go. Somehow then we made no progress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tahasildarsaheb Prlhad Ambadas of Khandwa today asked for &amp; obtained permission to return. There is Mr Pat&eacute; of Jalgaon &amp; LIngayat with him. They may go away tomorrow. We saw Sayin Baba during his evening stroll. He was in very good mood. At night there was the usual Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayana. During the arti in the wada, I understood the instructions given in the morning &amp; then felt happy. G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 18 January, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much to record today. I got up very early, prayed &amp; finding it yet wanting about an hour to the dawn, I lay down and got up in time to see the sunrise. I, Upasani, Bapusaheb Jog &amp; Bhishma read Paramamrita. Tahasildarsaheb Pralhad Ambadas, Mr Pat&eacute; &amp; his companion (Lingayat) returned to their places. The latter two got permission just in time to start. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; again after he returned to Masjid. He treated me very kindly &amp; while I was serving, he told me two or three tales. He said many people came to take his money. He never resisted but let them take it way. He only noted their names &amp; followed them. When they, got down for their meals, he killed them &amp; brought his money back. The other story was&nbsp; that there was a blind man. He used to live near the Takia here. A man enticed away his wife, &amp; eventually murded the blind man. Four hundred men assembled at the Chavadhi &amp; condemned him. They ordered him to be decapitated. This order was carried out, by the village hangman who did the work out of some motive &amp; not merely as a piece of duty. So the murder in the reincarnation was born as the son of the hangman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then commenced another tale. In the meantime a stranger Fakir came &amp; touched Sayin Baba &rsquo;s feet. Sayin Baba felt very angry or rather showed that he was so and shook off the Fakir who showed great tenacity &amp; persistence without losing his own equanimity. At last he went out &amp; stood near the compound wall on the outside. Sayin Baba was angry &amp; threw away the arti utensils and the dishes full of food brought by his worshippers. He lifted up Ram Maruti Bwa who declared afterwards that he felt very happy &amp; as if sent off to higher regions. One Bhagya &amp; a villager were also roughly handled by Sain Maharaj. Sitaram brought the arti and we finished the arti in the usual though a somewhat hurried way. Martand son of Mahalapat showed great presence of mind &amp; prevented confusion by directing that the arti should be finished where it was begun. He did so when Sayin Baba moved out of his usual place. Before finishing Sayin Baba resumed his seat &amp; all went much as usual, except that &ldquo;Udi &rdquo; was distributed wholesale &amp; not individually. He was not really angry of course and did the whole thing as a &ldquo;Lila &rdquo;. The whole affair made us late &amp; there was the feast given by Tatya Patil for the death of his father as a part of the obsequies So we did not finish our meals till about 6.30 P.M. It must have been a bit later for after it there was no time to do anything and we went to see the Sayin Maharaj come out for his stroll. He did so as usual &amp; we saluted him as usual. There was the usual Arti in the wada. Megha was too ill to stand up &amp; Sayin Baba foretold his end during the night. We then attended the Chavadhi procession it being the evening for it. I held the morchal as usual, and everything went on smooth. Sitaram did the arti. At night there was the Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; Ramayan of Dixit. G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P.S.</strong><br />I forgot to mention above that during the torrent of hard words that Sayin Maharaj poured out today he repeatedly said that he had saved my son Balvant, and then often repeated the phrase &ldquo;Fakir wished to kill Dadasaheb (meaning me)but I would not permit it.&rdquo; He mentioned one more name but I can not recall it now. G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 19 January, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a very sad day. I got up very early &amp;after finishing my prayers discovered that it yet wanted an hour or so to day break. So I lay down and was aroused for Kakad Arti by Bapusaheb Jog. Dixit Kaka told me that Megha died about 4 a.m. The Kakad Arti was done but Sayin Maharaj did not show his face clear &amp; did not appear to open his eyes. He never threw any glances spreading grace. After we returned arrangements were made for the cremation of Megha &rsquo;s body. Sayin Baba came just as the body was being brought out and loudly lamented his death. His voice was so touching that brought tears to every eye. He followed the body up to the bend in the made road near the village &amp; then went his usual way. Megha &rsquo;s body was taken under the Bada tree &amp; consigned to flames there. Sayin Baba could be distinctly heard lamenting his death even at that distance &amp; he was seen waving his hands &amp; swaying as if in arti to say goodbye. There was a good supply of dry fuel &amp; flames soon rose very high. Dixit Kaka, myself Bapusaheb Jog, Upasani, Dada Kelkar &amp; all else here were there &amp; praised the lot of Megha that his body was seen &amp; touched by Sayin Baba on the head heart &amp; shoulders &amp; feet by him. After finishing the ceremonies we ought to have sat praying but Bapusaheb Jog came &amp; I sat talking with him. When later I went to see Sayin Baba, he asked me how I spent the afternoon I was very sorry to confess that I had wasted it in talking. This was a lesson to me. I remembered how Sayin Baba foretold his death three days ago &ldquo;This is the last arti of Megha,&rdquo; how Megha felt that he had completed his service and was passing away, how he shed tears to think that he could not see Sath&eacute; whom he regarded as his Guru, and how he directed that the cows of Sayin Baba should be let loose. He never expressed any other wish. We all admired his life of extreme devotion &amp; I was sorry that I did not rest in prayer but listened to meaningless talk. Bhishma &amp; my son Balvant are not well. So there was no Bhajan. Dixit Kaka read Ramayan at night. Gupte his brother &amp;their families left this morning for Bombay. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 20 January, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up in time to say my prayers before day break and commence the routine of life here to suit every body else. The day promised to be pleasant &amp; so it turned out. I read Paramamrit with Bapusaheb Jog Upasani &amp; Ram Maruti. Bhishma &amp; my son Balvant are unwell. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned. He sat chatting pleasantly. Presently a Jahagirdar of a village somewhere here about, came &amp; Sayin Baba would not let him approach much less worship. Many people interceded for him in vain. Appa Kotya came &amp; did his utmost to secure at least the usual kind of Puja for the Jahagirdar &amp; Sayin Baba relented so far as to let him enter the Masjid and worship the pillar near the fire-place, but he would not give Udi. I thought Sayin Baba would get angry but he did not and our mid-day Arti passed off in the usual way. Bapusaheb Jog has been ordered by Sayin Baba to do all the artis at all times. I predicted this result two days before Megha passed off. After the midday meal I sat reading the newspapers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dixit &rsquo;s younger brother who practices at Khandwa came this morning &amp; his Bombay agent came in the afternoon. Dixit &rsquo;s brother tried to induce Dixit to return to work in vain. He applied to Sayin Baba, but Sayin Baba left the whole matter to Dixit himself. Bapusaheb Jog has also got four guests. The husband of his wife &rsquo;s sister who is the chief Treasury officer at Sangli has come here with his whole family on his way back from the Delhi Darbar His wife wished to take Mrs Bapusaheb Jog with her but Sayin Maharaj would not permit it. We saw Sayin Saheb as he came out for his evening stroll. Then there was the Wada Arti &amp; later on the Shej Arti. Dixit read Ramayan as usual. There was no Bhajan as Bhishma is indisposed &amp; my son Balvant is slightly worse. There is here Mr Moreshwar Janardas Pathar&eacute; with his wife. He is the victim of paralysis &amp; have suffered much. Joshi of Wasai has come &amp; brought some printed copies of the prayers sung here. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 21 January, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up &amp; attended the Kakad Arti. There were all the usual people except Bala Simpi. After the arti Sayin Baba followed the usual custom of using hard words against the internal enemies, by naming them as Appa Kotya, Telis, Waman Tatya etc. I read Parmamrit with Bapusaheb Jog Upasani, &amp; Rama Maruti. The guest of Bapusaheb Jog from Sangali attended our class. His name is Limay&eacute;. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; again after he returned to the Masjid. While we were at the Masjid Madhavarao Deshpande returned from Nagar. There was Dadasaheb Karandikar with him, &amp; a gentleman of Baroda. I was very much surprised to see Karandikar. It appears he came to Nagar on a case &amp; meeting Madhavarao Deshpande there decided to see Sayin Baba. We sat talking. Since getting into the council, he is convinced of the insincerity of Gokhale &amp; western professions. He returned to Nagar about 4.30 P.M. The Limayes also went. Permission was refused to them at first but subsequently granted by Sayin Baba. Sadashivarao Dixit wished to go only but was told to depart tomorrow morning with his family, children &amp; Rama Maruti. We saw Sayin Baba at the evening stroll and had Dixits Ramayan after the evening arti at the Wada. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 22 January, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early &amp; prayed, &amp; saw Sadashiva Rao Dixit, Haralal &amp; Ram Maruti &amp; the ladies of the first and the children Babu &amp; Subhadra whom we call Subhi off. They got permission to return last night. Then I began the routine of the day &amp; read Paramrita with Bapusaheb Jog, Upasani, &amp; Bhishma who is slightly better day. My son Balvant had two motions this morning. They will do him immense good. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned During the course of the worship he put two flowers in his two nostrils &amp; put two others between his ears &amp; the head. My attention was drawn to this by Madhavarao Deshpande. I thought this was an instruction. Sayin Baba repeated the same thing a second time &amp; when I interpreted it a second time in my own mind, he offered the chilam to me &amp; this confirmed me. He said something which I noted instantly &amp; particularly wished to remember but it went clean out of my mind &amp; no efforts made all through the day could bring it back. I am most surprized as this is the first experience of the kind. Sayin Baba also said that his order was supreme (Bala)which I understood to mean that I need not be anxious about the health of my son. By the time the mid-day arti was finished &amp; we returned, I found Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi standing in front of my lodging. I was very glad to see her. She arrived at the Masjid just as I left &amp; saluted Sayin Maharaj. The latter showed special favour by letting her worship then. After meals I lay down for a few minutes and Dixit read Ramayan &amp; some gatha of Nath Maharaj. Upasani was present &amp; Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi attended the class. She joined in the conversation &amp; appeared to be well informed in Vedanta. We saw Sayin Baba at the evening stroll &amp; again at Sheja Arti. Laxmibai sang a few songs. She is an aunt (mavasi) of RadhaKrishna Bai. At night at my request she did a little Bhajan &amp; Dixit read Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 23 January, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi </em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up in time for the Kakad Arti and finished my prayers a little after day break. Sayin Baba today in leaving his bed did not say even a single word, but when we saw him go out as usual, he showed a very jocose mood, noticing the absence of Kaka Dixit, said he was busy clearing his bowels. When he appeared Sayin Saheb said &ldquo;you did not clear yourself but thought you would bow to me first.&rdquo; We laughed all returned I read Parmamrit with Upasani &amp; Bapusaheb Jog &amp; Bhishma &amp; then went to see Sayin Baba at the Masjid. He was in a reticent mood &amp; never said a word and the midday arti passed off quietly. After it we returned &amp; had our meals. Madhavarao has obtained permission to send Sayin Baba &rsquo;s photo &amp; Udi to Hon Mrs Russell. I wished to write to her but did not feel myself in the mood and sat talking with a school master who has come here recently with his family to see Sayin Baba. Dixit read Ramayana &amp; then we went to see Sayin Baba at his evening stroll. He did not say much even then. At night Bhishma for the first time in this week, had his Bhajan. Some young men of the village also came to sing Bhajan &amp; then Dixit read Ramayan.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi thinks of staying here always &amp; Sayin Baba said she might do so for good. My son Balvant perspired this morning a little. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, 24 January, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi </em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow I overslept myself this morning. This made me late for everything. I had to hurry through all my usual routine. Somehow Mr Dixit was also late &amp; every body appeared to be in the same predicament. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; then read Paramamrit with Upasani, Bhishma &amp; Bapusaheb Jog. I then went to the Masjid to see Sayin Baba. Laxmi Bai Kaulgi attended our Paramrit class &amp; went to the Masjid after I reached. Sayin Baba called her his mother-in-law &amp; made a joke about her saluting him. This gave me the idea that she has been accepted by him as a disciple. The midday arti passed off in the usual way rather quietly. On my return from it I found Mr San&eacute; Mamledar of Kopargaon sitting in the verandah. He was doing revenue work in connection with the extension of Gasthan &amp; removal of the cemetery &amp; burning ghat. After meal I tried to write a few letters but sat talking with Mr San&eacute;. Then Mr Dixit read Ramayan and later on I went to the Masjid to see Sayinsaheb, but as all were dismissed soon, I took Udi &amp; stood near the Chavadhi. I met there the Mahomedan Kabripauthi gentleman who came to Amravati sometime ago with Sathaye &amp; Asnar&eacute;. In the evening there was the Arti at the Wada and then Sheja Arti at the Chavadhi. I held the Morachal as usual. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 25 January, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi </em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madhavarao Deshpande woke me up in the morning &amp; said that he had to call me more than once before I answered his call. I prayed &amp; attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Baba walked to the Masjid in silence On return we held our Parmamrit class with Upasani, Bapusaheb Jog, Bhishma &amp; Mrs Kaulgi. We finished the chapter on Mahavakya Viveka. Then we saw Sayinsaheb both when he went out &amp; after he returned to Masjid. The midday arti went off as usual &amp; Sayinsaheb gave me smoke very often. After meals I lay down for a while &amp; then we had Ramayan. Dixit read it, &amp; later on went to see Sayin Baba. He was in a pleased mood. At night there was the Wada Arti, Bhishma &rsquo;s Bhajan &amp; Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan. I may mention the fact that in the evening at strol time Sayin Baba told me nearly the whole previous history of Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi. I knew it to be correct as I knew the facts. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 26 January, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi </em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up very early by myself and miscalculating the time it wanted to sun-rise, I said my prayers &amp; walked up &amp; down in the verandah. I found that I was before time by about an hour &amp; a half. After sunrise I began the routine of life here &amp; went out. Then found that Dhande Baba had arrived from Poona. I naturally sat talking with him. He showed me the latest letter of Tilak. At last the coronation has come &amp; gone without seeing him out of jail. We sat talking about him &amp; Dr Garde who has needlessly got up some trouble just now and wishes particularly to harm me. We read a little of Paramamrita, saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; again after he returned. I felt unwell so I lay down for a while. Dhande Baba went away about 4 P.M. We had our afternoon Ramayan read by Dixit and then went to see Sayin Baba &amp; walked in front of the Chavadhi. At night there was the Wada Arti &amp; Sheja-Arti, Bhishma &rsquo;s Bhajan &amp; Ramayana of Dixit. I received some English letters today.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 27 January, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi </em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning prayed &amp; attended the Kakad arti. Sayin Baba did not quite go to the Masjid without a word &amp; yet he did not say much. I, Upasni, Bhishma &amp; Bapusaheb Jog read Paramamrit, saw Sayin Saheb go out &amp; again after he returned. The mid-day arti passed off easy and after it we had our meals as usual I lay down a while, then wrote a letter, and attended afternoon Ramayan read by Dixit. We saw Sayin Baba at his stroll &amp; he spoke pleasantly though in a serious mood. Towards its end he spoke loud &amp; angry and I am told that after dark he spoke louder still, making an occasion for the exhibition of his anger of the fact that Ibrahim, they stood near the Khind with his hands on the breach of the wall. Sayin Saheb's clothes were also washed by Radha Krishna Bai &amp; he was angry with her for having done so. Balabhau Joshi went today to Poona to read for the pleaders examination. He was not present at the Wade Arti. After it Bhishma had his Bhajan in the hall &amp; Dixit read Ramayan there. I shall sleep in the verandah. All traces of cold weather are fast disappearing here. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, 28 January, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept very well last night &amp; got up in time to pray before day break &amp; commence the routine of the day. I went about 8 a.m. to the temple of Khandoba where Upasani lives &amp; sat talking with him. It is a nice little place. We held our Parmamrit class in the quarters of Bapusaheb Jog, as talking &amp; discussing Vendantic subjects in the verandah of my lodgings disturbs my son Balvant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned to the Masjid. He asked me how we spent the morning &amp; I gave him an account of what we did. He appeared to be in a pleased mood and the mid-day arti passed off easy except that Radha Krishna Bai appeared to be put out and vexed &amp; she closed the doors So the arti things could not be got at soon. After the midday meal, I lay down for a while, then wrote a letter and attended the Puran of Ramayan by Dixit. Then we went &amp; saw Sayin Maharaj at his evening stroll. Then there was Wada Arti, but no Bhajan as Bhishma was unwell At night Dixit read Ramayan, after we returned from Shejarti. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 29 January, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up very early in the morning prayed &amp; found that I was a bit too early but I kept on &amp; attended the Kakad Arti. On my return I began the routine of the day. About 9 A.M. I went to Bapusaheb, with him &amp; Upasani, began the Parmamrit, but most unaccountably I felt so sleepy that I could make no progress. At last I returned to my lodgings &amp; lay down and fell asleep so long that I did not get up till 12.30 or 1 P.M. Madhavarao Deshpande &amp; others tried to awaken me for the Arti &amp; called me aloud but I did not respond. At last they went to the Arti &amp; somehow the matter reached the ears of Sayinsaheb &amp; he said that he would awaken me. Somehow I got up as the arti was being finished and attended the closing portion of it. I felt ashamed of having slept so long. I felt drowsy during the rest of the day. Narayan Rao Bamangankar came today from Sholap. He is a nice young man &amp; I sat talking with him. Then in the afternoon I attended the Purana of Dixit &amp; saw Sayin Saheb at the evening stroll. I had seen him when he went out between 9 &amp; 10 A.M. In the evening there was the Bhajan of Bhishma &amp; afterwards the Puran of Dixit. He read Ramayan as usual.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, 30 January, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early but did not like to leave bed &amp; begin work for fear of becoming again overcome by sleep as I was yesterday. I left bed before day break, finished by prayers and went to Bapusaheb Jog for our Parmamrit class. Upasani Shastri, Mrs Kaulgi &amp; Bapusaheb were there &amp; we made very good progress. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; saw him again after he returned to the Masjid. He asked me how I spent the morning &amp; I gave him an account of what we did. After the mid-day arti, I returned &amp; we had our meal. After it I sat reading the dailies &amp; then wrote a few letters. Later on Mr Dixit read Ramayan. Bhishma &amp; Madhavarao Deshpande attended the reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some two men of this village &amp; the younger brother of Sitaram Dengl&eacute; also came &amp; sat talking after the reading was finished. One of them recited a Chhanda on Ramayan. Then I went to see Sayin Baba at the Masjid &amp; he again asked how I spent the afternoon. When I mentioned my writing letters, he smiled &amp; said &ldquo;It is better moving your hands than sitting idle.&rdquo; We saw him have his evening stroll, and at night attended the Sheja-Arti. There was no Bhajan tonight but reading of Bhagavat took up all its time, and Dixit read Ramayana at night. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, February 1, Thursday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was somewhat late in getting up but was able to finish my prayer &amp;.in time to attend the Parmamrit class. The work was finished today &amp; we shall begin to revise it tomorrow I then went to the Masjid, sat with Sayin Maharaj &amp; accompanied him out up to Sathe&rsquo;s Wada. People assembled there as usual to salute him. I joined their group, saluted him and returning to Bapusaheb Jog&rsquo;s quarters, commenced Panchadasi &amp; explained the first ten verses which really contain the whole work in germinal form. Then I returned to my quarters wrote a few letters &amp; had them sent off, and went to the Masjid to attend the mid-day Arti. It passed off all right. Mr Manekachand of Ahmednagar who has this year taken the degree of LL.B. came there &amp; stayed here the whole day. We had our meals after we returned from the Arti. I sat reading Jnyaneshwari edited by Sakhrebwa. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, like the other editions, it does not solve all my difficulties. Later on Mr Dixit read Ramayan. Mr San&eacute; Mamledar of Shirdi, and Mr Sath&eacute;, Dy Collector &amp; Sub-divisional officer came &amp; sat talking for sometime. We resumed our Ramayan after they went and in the evening went to the Masjid to meet Sayin Baba at his evening stroll. After the Wada Arti, we attended the Sheja- Arti, Bhishma did not have his Bhajan but read Sakharoru&rsquo;s Prakrit Bagavat &amp; at night Mr Dixit read Ramayan. Today evening when we assembled at the Masjid before Sayin Baba started on his stroll, Sayin Saheb told Mr Dixit to give two hundred Rupees to my wife who was there champooing the legs of Sayinsaheb. This order was unaccountable. Has it come to this that I have to be maintained by charity!!! I prefer death to this. Sayin Saheb I think wishes to curb &amp; finally destroy my pride. So he is getting me used to poverty and the charity of others.<br />G.S.Khaparde<br />This money was not accepted.GSK</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, February 2, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up for the Kakad Arti, and after it ,we held our Parmamrit class but somehow fell to speak of Panchadasi and commenced to read it. It is about the best work on the subject &amp;none can take precedence of it. I went to see Sayin Maharaj before he went out &amp; accompanied him up to Sathe&rsquo;s Wada. &amp; afterwards attended the mid-day Arti. Today I got a letter from Amravati asking me to return to practice. I told Madhavarao Deshpande to ask Sayin Maharaj &amp; he promised to do so. After the midday meal I lay down for a while. Then Mr Dixit read Ramayan &amp; later on we went to see Sayin Baba go out for a stroll. We returned soon after it and at night there was Bhishma&rsquo;s Bhajan &amp; Dixit &rsquo;s Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, February 3, Saturday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was late in getting up and it appeared that there was a waive of laziness. Bapusaheb Jog was late, so was Mr Dixit and nearly every body else. After finishing my prayers I went to the Masjid but Sayin Baba told me to take Udi without entering it. I did so &amp; proceeding to the quarters of Bapusaheb Jog, sat reading Panchadasi with him, Upasani &amp; Mrs Kaulgi. We went on reading till midday &amp; then went to Sayin Babas Arti. After it we had our midday meal. I had a little rest and then sat reading &ldquo;Dasa-Bodha &rdquo;. Mr Dixit read Ramayan in the afternoon. Ganoba Aba, a local devotee of Sayin Baba, came to hear it. He knows a large number of verses &amp; has many by heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went &amp; saw Sayin Baba at his stroll. Madhavarao Deshpande told me that he asked Sayin Baba about my returning to Amravati, and the latter declined the necessary permission saying he was an old man &amp; did not like to lose his &ldquo;about &rdquo;. He said that some two hundred men went to a neighbouring town &amp; were taken up as rioters; that Madhavarao&rsquo;s name was introduced into the list of rioters, for nothing and that there was trouble about it. At night there was the Wada Arti &amp; the Sheja Arti and I attended both. Bhishma had no Bhajan but read Bhagavat instead &amp;then there was Ramayana of Dixit.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<br /><strong>1912, February 4, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early, attended the Kakad Arti and then finished my prayer. As I was bathing two gentlemen came enquiring about Narayan Rao Bamangaonkar. They were Lingayat Shastris. The eldest being known as Shivanand Shastri. There are two ladies with them. These ladies are Brahmans. The eldest of them is called Brahmanand Bai. Some three years ago she met a Luigayat lady by name Nijanand Bai at Nasik. She was an advanced yogini and instructed Brahmanand Bai. We all saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned to the Masjid. Brahmanand Bai worshipped him and sang two Artis very exquisitely. After the midday arti I had my meal &amp; lay down for a while. Then there was the Puran of Mr Dixit, and then we went to see Sayin Baba at his evening stroll. After the Wada arti at night Mr Dixit had his Purana &amp; then Bhishma had his Bhajan. The ladies Brahmanandbai &amp; her companion sang very beautifully &amp; we all enjoyed the Bhajan very much. Shivanand Shastri also sang. The Shastris &amp; the ladies come from Nasik. The are permanent inhabitants of the place. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, February 5, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, just as I finished my prayers, Rajarampant Dixit came from Nagpur. He is the elder brother of Kakasaheb Dixit. He went to see Sayin Saheb. I attended our class where we read Panchadasi and a verse of Amritanubhava with Bapusaheb Jog, Upasani Shastri, Shivanand Shastri, Brahmanand Bai &amp; others. We saw Sayin Saheb go out &amp; went to the Masjid after he returned. He was very king to me, said a few words &amp; in dismissing the company after Arti, called me by name, told me to shake off my sloth and look after all the ladies &amp; children. Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi was given today a piece of bread and told to go &amp; eat with RadhaKrishna Bai. This is a great food fortune. She will be happy hereafter. I invited Shivand Shastri, Brahmanand Bai &amp; all with them, to have their mid-day meal with us. After it I lay down for a few minutes. Then Dixit read Ramayan &amp; later we went to see Sayin Maharaj at his stroll. After the Wada Arti, there was the Sheja-Arti and at night Brahmananda Bai did the Bhajan very excellently. It was continued till after midnight. The subject of my going is broached today. It may be decided tomorrow. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912, February 6, Tuesday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up &amp; attended the Kakad Arti. Madhavarao Deshpande said that I would get permission to return home today. So I went with him &amp; Bamangaonkar to Sayin Saheb about 7.30 A.m. and Sayin Saheb told us to come again in the afternoon. So We returned &amp; I began the routine of the day. I Upasani &amp; Bapusaheb Jog read Panchadasi saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; attended the mid-day Arti. Brahmanandi Bai sang an Arti &amp; a few Padas there. Bapusaheb Jog went today to Kopargaon to get his pension so the arti was finished. After the mid-day meal I &amp; Bamangaonkar went to the Masjid. Kakasaheb Dixit was there. Sayin Saheb said that we might go tomorrow. Madhavarao Deshpande also came there. Sayin Saheb said that he had been considering long &amp; thinking day &amp; night. All were thieves, but we had to deal with them. He said he prayed to God night &amp; day for their improvement or removal but God delays and apparently does not approve of the attitude &amp; grant the prayer. He will wait for a month or two &amp; then see but whether living of dead he will have what he has been praying for. He will not go to Teli or Wani &amp; never beg of them. People are not good &amp; devoted. They are unsettled in mind &amp; so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added that a few friends would gather together talk divine wisdom &amp; sit &amp; contemplate. He mentioned a few thousand Rupees but I do not remember in what connection he said it. I then returned &amp; we had the Ramayan Puran by Dixit. Later on we went to see him come out for his stroll He was in a pleased mood. Mr Rajarampant Dixit went away today to Khandawa. Upasani Shastri lost his wife. The sad news came by letter I, Dixit &amp; Madhavarao went to Upasani, condoled with him and brought him to the Wada. Fakir Baba appears to have asked about my going away &amp; Sayin Baba answered that I told him that I would go tomorrow. When my wife spoke about my going, Sayin Baba said that I did not ask for permission personally, so he could not say. I happened to go there soon after &amp; Sayin Baba said that I could not go away without taking five hundred Rupees from Dada Bhat &amp; two hundred from some one else, &amp; making them all over to him. At night the Wada Arti was a bit late as Bapusaheb Jog had to return from Kopargaon. Brahmanand Bai &amp; Shivanand Shastri did Bhajan. So did Bhishma.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, February 7, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early, prayed, and held our Panchadasi class as usual. I did not go to Sayin Maharaj to ask for permission. We saw him go out &amp; I went to the Masjid after he returned. I found that Sayin Maharaj was sitting &amp; in the yard a man was exhibiting tricks taught by him to a monkey. There was also a professional singer &amp; dancer. She had a good voice &amp; gave religious songs. Later on came, Brahmananda Bai, her companion Sulubai &amp; Shivanand Shastri. They did the Puja &amp; Brahmanand Bai whom they call Mazisaheb, sang very beautifully. Sayin Saheb ordered the Pat &amp; to be brought &amp; when all was arranged &amp; we stood at our posts, Mazisaheb again rendered two songs so excellently that we stood spell- bound. I think Sayinsaheb liked them. Then we did the usual Arti &amp; returned for our midday meal. Mazisaheb &amp; her people fed at my lodgings. After the meal Bamangaonkar &amp; Mazisaheb with all her people went to Sayinsaheb to ask for permission to return. Mazisaheb and Salubai got the permission &amp; went away by cart. Shivanand Shastri &amp; Bamangaonkar were detained by Sayin Maharaj &amp; stayed. I lay down &amp; had a good nap. Then Mr Dixit read Ramayan &amp; after it I read Dasabodha by myself. We all saw Sayinsaheb have his evening stroll, and after the Wada Arti, We attended the Sheja-Arti. At night Bhishma read Bhagavat and Mr Dixit read Ramayana. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, February 8, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up for Kakad Arti, &amp; after it began the routine of the day. Narayan Rao Bamangaonkar got permission to return. So he had some-things for delivery at Amravati from my wife, &amp; actually left by a tonga. Before he star, Ganpatrao, the son of the Karthari of my relation Mulatik of Satara came with the customary presents of Sesamum for Tilsankrant. They consist of very artistically made things out of sugared sesamum. Balvant for the first time in these three weeks, ventured out as far as the Masjid &amp; put his head on the feet of Sayin Maharaj. He has improved so far. Ganpatrao wishes my son Balvant to go with him to Satara for Ranga Panchami. I referred him to Sayin Saheb. The midday arti went off as usual except towards the end, when Sayinsaheb exhibited anger. We spent the afternoon as usual in Dixit reading Ramayan &amp; I reading to myself Das Bodh. We held our Panchadasi class also in the morning. We saw Sayin Saheb at his evening stroll. One Mr Kulkarni has come here from Bombay. He has a laboratory there where he tests ores etc. He said he saw me at Surat in 1907. We sat talking about old things. At Bhishma had his Bhajan &amp; Dixit read Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, February 9, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual, prayed, and attended the Panchadasi class. During it We saw Sayin Maharaj go out. After finishing the class I went to the Masjid. Sayin Baba was in very good mood. The young boy Kishya whom we call Pisya came there as usual. On seeing him Sayin Saheb that Pisya saw a Rohilla in his previous birth, that he was a very good man, that he prayed long and came as guest to Sayin Saheb&rsquo;s grand father. The latter had a sister who used to live separate. That Sayin Saheb was a young boy himself then &amp; playfully suggested that the Rohilla should marry her. This was to be and she did eventually marry her. The Rohilla lived there with his wife for a long time and ultimately went away with her, no body knew where. He died and Sayin Saheb put him into the womb of his present mother. Pisya, he said, would by very fortunate and the protector of thousands. The Midday Arti passed off as usual. During it Sayinsaheb said something to Shivanand Shastri &amp; made signs. The Shastri unfortunately did not catch their import. Sayin Saheb made signs to Bapusaheb Jog also. Mr Oke pleader of Thana is here. I asked him to remember me to Baba Gupte &amp; other friends. In the afternoon there was Ramayan read by Mr Dixit as usual. Then we went to see Sayin Saheb go out for his stroll and in the evening attended the Sheja Arti after the Wada Arti. At night Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dixit read Ramayana.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912, February 10, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended Kakad Arti in the morning. Ganpatrao obtained permission this morning to go to Satara with my son Balvant. Madhava Rao Deshpande was with them at the time. I, Bapusaheb Jog Upasani &amp; Mrs L Kaulgi, had our Panchadasi class &amp; after it I went to the Masjid. Sayin Baba was in a very pleasant mood and said that his body had been severed from his legs, that he can raise up the former but not the latter. He said he had a fight with the Teli, that when he was young he raised money for family purposes and agreed to serve the creditor to repay the debt, but he found he could not work, so he applied marking nut to his eyes &amp; another irritant (Shar) to his body and became ill. He was laid up for a year, but as soon as he recovered, he worked night and day &amp; paid off the debt. He sat talking very pleasantly but towards the end of the mid-day Arti, began to exhibit signs of impatience. Mr Gadre pleader of Nassik is here. I met him in Dixit&rsquo;s Wada &amp; sat talking with him. I knew him before. Mr Dixit read Ramayan in the afternoon &amp; at night. Bhishma had Bhajan in the evening. Ganpat Rao &amp; my son Balvant went today to Amravati. From there they will proceed to Satara. We naturally miss them much. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 11, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time I finished my prayer this morning, I found Mr Gadre up &amp; sat talking with him. He got permission to return &amp; went back to Nasik. We saw Sayin Saheb go out &amp; held our Panchadasi class with Upasani, Bapusaheb Jog, Mrs L Kaulgi. Mr Lele who is Revenue Inspector of Nasik District also attended the class. He appears a very nice man &amp; Sayin Maharaj likes him much. I went to the Masjid as usual after Sayin Baba returned &amp; found many men sitting there. They were mostly strangers. Among them was one of Akola Police who on seeing me, said that he had resigned his post and had taken service with Govind Rao Deshmukh Barrister of Nagpur. After the midday Arti &amp; meal I lay down for a while &amp; then attended the Puran of Ramayan by Mr Dixit. Later on we went to see Sayin Baba at his evening stroll &amp; meeting Mr.Lel&eacute; there, stood talking with him. In the evening there was the Wada Arti &amp; later on the Sheja Arti, Bhishmas recital of Bhagavat &amp; Mr Dixit Ramayan. Shivanand Shastri did not get permission today to return. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 12, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early &amp; attended the Kakad Arti. Later on we held our Panchadasi class, &amp; saw Sayin Baba go out. The midday Arti passed as usual. I spoke to Bapusaheb Jog to ask Dada Kelkar if reading in the afternoon from 5 to 6 would suit him. Bapusaheb Jog forgot to ask him. In the afternoon Mr Dixit read Ramayan as usual. As I descended the stairs after it, Shivanand Shastri who is still here, drew my attention to a man who has come here &amp; shows signs of being in a frenzy. The man moved his hands &amp; feet, glared about, threw shoes at us. I called Mr Dixit. At one time we thought him drunk. Later on it appeared, he only pretended to have got into a religious frenzy to gain consequence. I took him to Sayin Baba who ordered him out. Mr San&eacute; the father of the Mamledar of Kopargaon came today &amp; sat talking with us for sometime. He is a very nice gentleman of the old type &amp; said that he saw me first at Dhulia during the Provincial Conference of 1908. After the wada arti there was Bhishma &rsquo;s Bhajan. I may mention that after the midday arti I invited two men to breakfast. One was from Pauwel &amp; the other from Dharna Jari. They appeared religiously inclined &amp; poor. Before Puran at night We went to the Shimant Pujana ceremony in connection with the wedding of the daughter of the local school master. Then we had Mr Dixits Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 13, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very late in getting up this morning. So all my usual programme was correspondingly thrown forward. After prayer I, Upasani, Bapusaheb Jog &amp; Mrs Laxmibai Kaulgi held our Panchadasi class and finished the second chapter. Then we saw Sayin Saheb go out and went to the wedding of the daughter of the local school master. His house is small and the people here would not oblige him by letting him put up a Mandap. So we sat in the Govt Chavadhi, smoking with Fakir Baba who was very pleasant. The wedding was celebrated later than what we thought it would be. Thence we went to the Masjid. Sayin Baba was in a pleased mood and the midday Arti passed off as usual. After it we returned and had our mid-day meal. My wife, Bhishma &amp; Bandu fasted on account of Ekadasi. I lay down for a while &amp;then sat reading. Mr Dixit went as usual to the Masjid after the midday meal &amp; Sayin Maharaj told him to rest a while. So he returned and lay down &amp; did not get up till about 5 P.M. We should have begun our Parmamrit class then for the benefit of Dada Kelkar but that he had to go out on some urgent business. So Mr Dixit read Ramayan instead &amp; then we went to the Masjid. Sayin Maharaj gave me Udi as soon as I step in. So I exclaimed that it was telling me to go away. Thereupon he said &ldquo;who tells you to go? Sit down.&rdquo; Then he sat talking pleasantly and said that the cow now possessed by Mr Dixit belonged originally to Mahalsapati. Then it went to Aurangabad then to Jalna &amp; has now come back as the property of Mr Dixit. &ldquo;God knows whose property it is.&rdquo; Looking at me he said &ldquo;nobody who has firm faith in god, wants for any thing.&rdquo; My wife &amp; others were there. We all saw him at his evening stroll Then there was the Wada Arti &amp; later on Sheja Arti. At night Bhishma had his Bhajan &amp; Mr Dixit read Ramayan. Sayin Baba today both after the mid-day arti &amp; after the Sheja Arti told me to go to Wada specially calling me by name. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 14, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early, attended the Kakad Arti &amp; was very much struck by the fact that Sayin Baba, on leaving the Chavadhi made passes with his short stick towards the East, north &amp; South. Then he proceeded with hard words as usual. We held our Panchadasi class as usual, saw Sayin Baba go out and later on went to the Masjid as usual. Sayin Baba told two stories. One was that there was a traveller who was accosted in the morning by a demon (Rakshasa). The traveller looked upon it as a bad omen, but on proceeding further met two wells the sweet water of which slaked his thirst. When he felt hungry, he met a husbandman who on the suggestion of his wife, supplied food. He saw a field ripe with corn &amp; wished to have Hurda. The owner of the field gave it to him. So the traveller felt happy &amp; proceeded merrily smoking. In the forest through which he was passing he met a tiger, lost courage &amp; hid himself in a cave. The tiger was very big &amp; wandered about him. Sayin Baba happened to be passing that way instilled courage into the traveller, got him out &amp; put him on his way saying &ldquo;the tiger would not hurt unless you hurt him some way. &rdquo;The other story was that Sayin Baba had four brothers, one of whom used to go out, beg &amp; bring cooked food, bread &amp; corn. His wife used to give out just enough for their father &amp; mother but starved all the brothers. Sayin Baba then got a contract, brought the money home &amp; every one was supplied with food including the well-to-do brother. Later on the brother got leprosy. Every one shunned him. The father turned him out. Then Sayin Baba used to feed him &amp; see to his comfort. Ultimately the brother died. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp; after it we had our food &amp; I had some rest. Shivanand Shastri, &amp; Thakur of Vijayadurga went away today. The Vyaki of the local master invited all to a meal today. I declined but all others went. Sayin Baba, at the evening stroll asked why I did not go &amp; I told him the truth, that I could not manage two meals in the course of one afternoon. Sayin Baba looked immersed in care, gazed steadily at the East &amp; West, &amp; Dismissed us all with the usual words &ldquo;Go the Wada.&rdquo; At night Bhishma had his Bhajan and Mr Dixit read Ramayan. <br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 15, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual prayed, and held our Panchadasi class with Upasani Shastri, Bapusaheb Jog &amp; Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi. We saw Sayin Saheb go out and continued our class. After it I went to the Masjid as usual &amp; sat listening to what Sayin Saheb was saying. He was in a pleased mood &amp; said that he had laboured very hard, had gone without food for months, fed on leaves of &ldquo;Kula Takala &rdquo; Nimb, and other trees. He said God was very good to him, for, life never became extinct though all flesh got wasted &amp; bones appeared to be in danger of crumbling away. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp; after it we returned for our meals. My wife &amp; others wished to go to Kopargaon tomorrow for Shivaratri. Sayin Saheb thought it unnecessary, but they persisted and ultimately got a permission in a way. Today after the afternoon Puran, we held a class for Parmamrit for the benefit of Dada Kelkar. We did not progress much as it was the first day. We saw Sayin Maharaj at his evening stroll, and then after the Wada Arti, attended the Sheja Arti. Balasaheb Bhate attended it. He used to hold the Peacock tail before it came to me. So I tendered it back to him. I got a fan instead. Balasaheb Bhate has made considerable progress. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 16, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Saheb exhibited great grace accompanied by hard words. We held our Panchadasi class in the morning after prayer. My wife &amp; others could not go to Kopargaon as they could not get a cart. We saw Sayin Baba go out. Mr Morgaonkar has come &amp; distributed a translation of Para-Puja. There is a Shastri from Kalyan -Bhivandi. He is staying with Bapusaheb Jog and is a very quiet nice man. We fasted today on account of Shivaratri. There was the afternoon Puran of Dixit &amp; after it we held our Paramamrit class &amp; made good progress. We saw Sayin Saheb at mid-day arti &amp; also at the evening stroll. He was in a very pleased mood. After the Wada Arti, there was Puran &amp; Bhajan as usual. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 17, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, prayed and held our usual Panchadasi class with Upasani, Bapusaheb Jog, Kunt&eacute; Shastri of Kalyan, &amp; Moregaonkar. We finished the third chapter today. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; again after he returned. He was in very pleasant mood &amp;made jokes. The midday arti passed off as usual &amp; after it we had our food. Mr Dixit is thinking of going to Nagpur for the moruj of his son. He wishes to take with him as many from here as he can, but everything depends on the orders which Sayin Saheb gives. In the afternoon there was Dixits Ramayan &amp; then we held our Parmamrit class, &amp; made good progress. Later on we saw Sayin Maharaj at his stroll, then there was the Wada Arti &amp; Sheja- Arti. At the latter the big fan came to me. On our return Kunt&eacute; Shastri of Kalyan did Kirtan. He told the story of Uttargograhana. He is an old man &amp; considering his age which is 80 years, his powers of endurance, his energy and all else is very praiseworthy &amp; remarkable. Mr Dixit had his Ramayana &amp; Bhishma read Bhagavat. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 18, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madhavarao Deshpande woke me up in the morning &amp; after prayers attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Saheb took it very cooly and hard words said as usual after it, were of a very mild character. Mr Dixit is thinking of going to Nagpur for the thread ceremony of his son. He asked Sayin Baba to let me go with him &amp; got an evasive reply. I feel almost sure that I shall not be permitted to go. My wife is very anxious to go. While I was in our Panchadasi class with Upasani Shastri, Bapusaheb Jog, &amp; others, Mr Nanasaheb Chandorkar came &amp; sat with Mr Dixit. I met him when I went to see Sayin Saheb after our class. Sayin Saheb was talking with him in the usual way, about Teli, Waman Tatya, Appa Kotya, etc. The midday Arti passed off as usual except that towards the end of it Sayin Baba got a bit impatient and told people to clear out fast. I had my food with Mr Dixit in company with Nanasaheb Chandodkar &amp; I asked the latter to resume his conversation with me which was broken off when he was here on a short visit. He said the matter was in the hands of Sayin Baba. He has brought with him, artificial garden with a big moon, such as we have on marriage occasions. It was ordered by Radha Krishna Bai. I lay down for a while. Then Nanasaheb went away about 4 P.M. &amp; Mr Dixit read Ramayan. Later on we held our Paramrit class &amp; after it went to see Sayin Saheb at his evening stroll. The &ldquo;moon &rdquo; was lit &amp; shed very splendid light. My wife renewed her request about returning to Amravati &amp; was as usual given an evasive reply by Sayin Saheb. After the Wada Arti Mr Dixit read Ramayan &amp; Bhishma had his Bhajan. We finished early to admit Mr Dixit &amp; Madhavarao Deshpande making preparations to depart tomorrow early in the morning. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 19, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Dixit, his wife, Madhavarao Deshpande, Hiralal &amp; others went away this morning. The Dixits went to Nagpur for the ninnja of their son Babu. Madhavarao went to Harda for a similar ceremony in a friends house. After prayer we held our Panchadasi class. Morgaonkar said that he lost his watch &amp; chain. They were both valuable being of gold. They were searched for in vain. We saw Sayin Saheb go out &amp; again after he returned. The midday Arti passed off as usual except that there were two Chamars instead of only one. Balasaheb Bhate worshipped &amp; wished to stay for the Arti but Sayin Baba ordered him home. After food I lay down for a while and then We continued our Panchadasi class, with our usual members. Later on Dada Kelkar Bala Shimpi &amp; others came. We saw Sayin Maharaj at his evening stroll, &amp; after the Wada Arti attended the Sheja Arti when the artificial gardens and moon were used for the first time. They looked very nice &amp; attracted a large crowd. Sayin Saheb did not appear to dislike them. I think the moon is helpful. Bhishma read Bhagavat and ten Samasa of Dasabodha tonight. Mr Nate kar alias Hamsa writes to me today to say that I ought to return to Amravati by the end of this month. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 20, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We attended the Kakad Arti &amp; the remarkable part of it was that Sayin Saheb left the chavadhi and entered the Masjid without saying a single word except &ldquo;God is the greatest of all &rdquo;. After prayer I, Upasani, Bapusaheb Jog, Bhishma and Mrs Laxmi Bai Kaulgi held our Panchadasi class. When I went to the Masjid after Sayin Saheb returned from his morning walked, he said he wished to get the Masjid rebuilt. He said there was enough money for it &amp; went on talking about it. Some Baroda ladies of the Shirke family have come here. They attended the mid-day Arti. It passed off as usual. Radha Krishna Bai had the eggs of ostrich. Ostrich hung up where Sayin Saheb sits and he had them pulled down &amp; thrown away. We continued our Panchadasi class in the afternoon &amp; I went to the Masjid about 6 P.M. Sayin Saheb told two stories of which, do what I like, I can not recall the first. I asked my wife &amp; all others present &amp; they also forget which is wonderful. The other story was that there was an old women living with her son. He used to assist in the disposal of the dead bury, bury of every body in the village &amp; got remuneration for it. There prevailed a sort of plague &amp; many died. So his emoluments were great. Allah met her one day &amp; told her not to profit by the trade of her son. She spoke about it to her son but the latter paid no attention &amp; eventually died. The old woman then maintained herself by spinning cotton. Allah told her to go to the house of the relations of her husband but she declined to do so. One day some Brahmans came to purchase cotton from her, spied out all the details of her house and broke into it at night. One of the burglars stood naked before her. She told him to run away, as the townspeople would murder him for his crime. So the man ran away. Eventually the old woman died &amp; was born as a daughter of the burglar. I was not quite sure that I understand the story quite right. We saw Sayin Saheb at his evening stroll &amp; at night, after the Wada Arti Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Das Bodha. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 21, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual but my prayers were disturbed by the noise which Devaji whom we call Sakshatkaribwa made. I managed to control my mind and finished my prayers. Later we saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; held our Panchadasi class. After it I went to the Masjid and saw Sayin Baba being served by the Baroda ladies of the Shirke family. A dancing woman of Bombay arrived today &amp; sang a few songs in the Masjid. She says she is a pupil of BalKrishna Bwa. Sayin Baba heard her songs. Then the midday Arti passed off as usual. Sayin Baba was in a very good mood. After midday meal I lay down for a while and then continued our Panchadasi class with our usual members. About sunset I went to see Sayin Baba at his evening stroll, and again after Wada Arti, for the Sheja Arti. The procession &amp; other arrangements were very grand today. The Bhajan was with cymbals &amp; all. The Bombay dancing girl gave a few songs in the Masjid also after the Sheja Arti. At night Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dasbodh.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 22, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />This morning there was Kakad Arti &amp; we all attended it. The ladies of the Shirke family went away soon after the arti with their attendants. The Bombay dancing girl also went away with her men. She said she wished to go to Amravati. We held our Panchadasi class. After it I learnt that my wife had a dream this morning that Sayin Baba sent her a message by Bandu to go away today before 9 A.M. Sayin Baba also asked Dada Kelkar &amp; Bala Shimpi whether I was talking of going away. There is note from Natekar (Hamsa) that I would be permitted to return to Amravati about the end of this month. All this raised the hopes of my wife but at the mid-day Arti time there was no mention of the matter made by Sayin Baba. Madhavarao Deshpande returned in time for the midday arti from Harda. His wife &amp; children also came from Ahmednagar. After the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp;then continued our Panchadasi class till nearly nightfall when I hastened to the Masjid saw Sayin Saheb &amp; took Udi. At night Bhishma read Das Bodh &amp;Bhagavat &amp; had Bhajan. Mr Balasaheb Bhate, Mr Bapusaheb Abkari Inspector &amp; some children of the latter came to see me at night and we sat talking for sometime on the usual subject of the wonders daily worked by Sayin Baba. Madhavarao Deshpande was also present then. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 23, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual, prayed &amp; in the morning held the Panchadasi class. Besides our usual members, a lady from Nasik by name Mrs Sundarabai was present. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; again at the Masjid after he returned to the Masjid. He told me a story, how when he was young, he went out one morning &amp;suddenly became a girl &amp; continued to be so, for sometime. He did not give many details. The midday Arti passed off as usual. Many people came to worship today. After the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp;then continued our Panchadasi class. Madharao asked Sayin Baba today about my return and got a reply to the effect that times being very unfavourable to me, I would have to remain her a few months more. In the evening we went to see Sayin Baba at the evening stroll &amp; then after the Wada Arti, there was Sheja Arti and later on Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Das Bodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 24, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti &amp; then held our Panchadasi class. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out &amp; later on attended the Masjid for the midday Arti. Everything went off very much as usual, &amp; after the midday meal I lay down for a while. Mr San&eacute; Mamledar of Kopargaon and Mr Nanasaheb Revenue Inspector came with Balasaheb Bhate &amp; sat talking for sometime. After they went away we continued our Panchadasi class but the progress was very slow. We saw Sayin Baba at his evening stroll and in the evening the Nasik ladies assisted in the Bhajan after the Wada Arti. They have good voices but they appear to be very weak &amp;can make no sustained effort. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 25, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early,prayed, &amp; saw Mr Madhavarao Deshpande leave Shirdi for Nagpur. From there he will go to Gwalior for the wedding of Nanasaheb Chandorkar &rsquo;s son &amp; will return by stages, seeing Benares, Allahabad, Gya Mathura &amp; other holy places on the way. We held our Panchadasi class but Upasani was feeling unwell, so our progress was slow. We attended the midday Arti, and after the midday meal, resumed our Panchadasi class &amp; made some progress. In the evening, after the Wada Arti, we attended the Sheja Arti, and after it Bhishma read Dasabodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 26, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Baba went to the Masjid without saying much. The Nasik ladies went away this morning. Then we held our class &amp; saw Sayin Baba go out, &amp; again after he returned to the Masjid. He told a story about his brother having misbehaved once &amp; being out casted in consequence. Sayin Baba looked after him &amp; eventually had him readmitted to the caste. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp; after the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp; then We continued our Panchadasi class. One Mr Datar has come from Poona with his son who appears to be a pleader. They are staying in the hall. We attended the Masjid to see Sayin Saheb at the stroll. After the Wada Arti, there was Bhagavat &amp; Dasbodh &amp; Bhajan in which Mrs Kaulgi and Sonubai assisted. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 27, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual, prayed and held our Panchadasi class. For once we missed Sayin Baba going out &amp; were not able to see him till he was on his way back. When I went to the Masjid about 11.15 A.m. Sayin Baba said that he Walked through a field in which there were very big parrots. The parrots were not scared away by his presence and he stood long admiring their size &amp; colour. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp;after meal, I lay down for a while and then resumed our Panchadasi class till nearly nightfall when we went to see Sayin Maharaj at his evening stroll. At night there was the Wada Arti &amp;then the Sheja-Arti. Bhishma read Bhagavat and Dasbodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 28, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti &amp; was on my return praying when Dhonde Baba arrived from Poona. He returned recently from Burmah and I sat talking with him about the health of my friend Tilak and the state of his mind. It is as good as it can be under the circumstances. He wishes me to return to my practice at the bar but that depends upon what Sayin Saheb orders. We held our Panchadasi class and Mr Balasaheb Bhate attended it. We saw Sayin Saheb go out &amp; later on I went to the Masjid after he returned. He asked me if Jivamuni would pay. I could not make out what Jivamuni meant but replied that Jivamuni would if ordered. He said Jivamuni would not. He gave me a lot of fruits &amp; sweets. The midday Arti passed off as usual. Today was Ekadasi &amp; nobody except myself &amp; Raghunath had a breakfast or the midday meal. Dhonde Baba also fasted. He returned to Poona about 4 P.M. with Bhau son of Dada Kelkar. We then continued our Panchadasi class &amp; in the evening went to see Sayin Maharaj at his stroll. He was in a very pleased mood walked light, made jokes &amp; so on. After the Wada Arti Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dasbodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 February 29, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I prayed in the morning and held our usual Panchadasi class. While we were at it Sayin Baba passed through and we saw him near the Sath&eacute; Wada. He appeared very much tired. I saw him again after he returned and he appeared to be in a very placid mood. He said that Balasaheb Bhate was a Khatu, that his wife was a &ldquo;Saliu &rdquo; i..e. weaver &amp; that his son Babu was also a Sali. Sayin Saheb said further that Wassudeo Kaka, was a Rajput in his former birth and bore the name of Jaising, that he was fond of meat &amp; that Sayin Saheb &amp; others used to make him very angry by asking him if he wanted the head of a goat, that this Jaising had three sons who served in the army and a daughter who turned out bad, became the keep of a Barwar, bore children by him and died thus. The midday Arti passed off as usual except that Waman Tatya who came after it &amp; wished to worship got a good harvest of hard words. After the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp; then we continued our Panchadasi class till evening when we went to see Sayin Saheb at his stroll. After the wada Arti I went to the Masjid to attend the procession to Chavadhi &amp; the Sheja Arti there. Sayin Saheb exhibited an angry mood, abused those that had got on to the roof of the Masjid for lighting lamps, and at the time when the procession started he threw his stick at Mrs Tai Jog the wife of Bapusaheb. At the Chavadhi I thought he would beat Bapusaheb Jog for he approached the latter held his hands and demanded why arti was done, but after a while he beat Bala Simpi with his stick and later on TrimbakRao whom he calls Maruti. Bala Simpi ran away but TrimbakRao received the blow standing and prostrated himself before Sayin Saheb. I think he received a full measure of favour and got ahead by at least a stage. Sayin Saheb was talking loudly when we returned. I sat talking with Balasaheb Bhate. Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dasbodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 1, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti &amp;then after prayer held our Panchadasi class but both Bapusaheb Jog &amp; Upasani delayed as they got themselves shaved &amp; we could not actually begin until Sayin Baba went out &amp; we saw him near the Sathe Wada. When we did actually begin we made progress. I went to Masjid about 11 A.m. and Sayin Baba seemed to be in a very good mood but looked very much tired. Trimbak Rao came very much near to abusing Fakir Baba for what appeared to me to be a very trifling matter. The midday arti passed off as usual. Sayin Baba remembered Mr Dixit, Nanasaheb Chandorkar &amp; Sathe. After meals we continued our Panchadasi class &amp; made good progress. We saw Sayin Baba at his evening stroll &amp; at night there was Bhagavat &amp; Dasabodha read by Bhishma. He also did the Bhajan and Bala Saheb Bhat&eacute; attended. A Teli living opposite to us died in the evening. His wife Sattrabai &amp; daughter Gopi used to work as our domestic servants. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 2, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I prayed &amp; held our Panchadasi class in the morning. During it we saw Sayin Maharaj go out. When I went to the Masjid about 11 A.m. he said he was ill &amp; complained of pain in the abdomen. There was a band which played today before the Masjid. It was engaged by a Marwadi for a wedding in his house The midday Arti passed off as usual. Today was Holi. So I invited Bhai, Keshava &amp; Devaji to the midday meal. We had it in a sumptuous style. After it I lay down for a while &amp; then continuing our Panchadasi class we finished The Tripti Deep and commenced Kutastha deep. We saw Sayin Maharaj at the evening stroll &amp; after the Wada Arti, again at the Sheja Arti which passed off with great ease, Sayin Baba being in very good humour. Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dasabodh at night. Balasaheb Bhate came for Dasbodh.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1912 March 3, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti &amp; Sayin Baba looked pleased and passed into the Masjid without any hard words. Abdulla in trying to remove a hanging lamp by accident, left it so as to drop to the ground &amp; get shattered. I thought this might anger Sayin Baba but it did not. He took no notice of it. We held our Panchadasi class &amp; sat in my room as it was very windy in the verandah. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; again after he returned. He said that in a former birth I was with him for two or three years, and went into royal service though there was enough at home to live in comfort. I wished to learn further particulars but Sayin Saheb would not communicate them. The midday Arti passed off as usual and after the midday meal I lay down for sometime &amp; then continued our Panchadasi class. In the evening we saw Sayin Saheb go out for his stroll and at night Bhishma had his Bhajan after the Wada Arti. Today one Dr.Ranad&eacute; practising at Dhulia has come. He says he is related to the Ranade who used to live opposite to Baba Maharaj. He adds that he met me at Sinhagad. There is also a Bombay gentleman Pals&eacute; by caste who says he visited me at Amravati, some years ago. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 4, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, prayed and held our Panchadasi class. We saw Sayin Baba go out and about 11 A.m. I went to the Masjid as usual. Sayin Baba was in a very good mood &amp; sat talking, but he told no story worth recording. The midday Arti passed off as usual. My wife was late in going to worship Sayin Saheb, but he very kindly desisted from his meal &amp; let her worship him. In the afternoon we continued our Panchadasi class till dark when we went to see Sayin Baba at his stroll. After the Wada Arti there was the Sheja Arti. There was more music than usual &amp; Sayin Baba was very quiet all through. At night Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dasabodh. Mr Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; was present during the reading of the latter. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 5, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up so early that I was able to finish my prayer attend to my morning calls &amp; lie down for about an hour before it was time for Kakad Arti. I attended it &amp; then held our Panchadasi class but I felt unwell &amp; we could make no progress. My stomach would appear to be out of order &amp; I had two motions. We saw Sayin Saheb go out &amp; then went to the Masjid when he returned. He did not talk much &amp; the Midday Arti passed off without any incident. After meal I lay down &amp; slept long. Mr Bapusaheb Jog went with Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; to Kopargaon to get their pensions &amp; there was therefore no class in the afternoon. I was also not well &amp; had motions. I went to see Sayin Maharaj at his evening stroll &amp; on my return felt so sleepy that I lay down, while yet Bhishma was reading Dasbodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 6, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept very sound last night &amp; felt correspondingly better in the morning. After finishing my prayer, we held our Panchadasi class &amp; during it saw Sayin Saheb go out. We finished the Kutashtha deep &amp; began the Dhyanasdipa. After the class I went to the Masjid as usual and Sayin Baba happened to be in a very good mood. So I sat serving him. He said he felt as if tied at the waist, chest &amp; near the neck, that he thought Nagavdi leaves were put on his eyes, &amp; on opening them to find out what the matter was, he was surprised to see something which he could not understand. He caught a leg of it &amp; then it lay down. He tried to light his fire but the fuel being not quite dry would not ignite. He thought he saw four dead bodies removed and could not understand whose they were. Sayin Saheb kept on speaking in the same strain saying that his left upper &amp; lower jaws were very painful and that he could not even drink water. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp; after the meal I lay down for a while and then sat reading Vakyavritti. Later on we continued our Panchadasi class, till dark &amp; then Saw Sayin Saheb at his stroll. After the Wada Arti there was the Sheja Arti. The circle of lamp-jets could not be carried in the procession as usual &amp; as placed in the little room where Sayin Saheb sleeps. It caused considerable inconvenience &amp; I do not think Sayin Saheb liked it. At night Bhishma read Bhagavat &amp; Dasabodha. Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; attended the reading of the latter. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 7, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Maharaj was in a very pleased mood &amp; danced as he left the Chavadhi &amp; went towards the Masjid. We held our Panchadasi class &amp; saw Sayin Baba going our during it. I went to the Masjid after the class. There was a large crowd. It gradually thinned. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp; after the meal I lay down for a while. Bandoa want to Rahata for the weekly Bazar. In the afternoon we continued our Panchadasi class. I did the reading and finished the Dhyanadeepa. Then I went to see the Sayin Saheb at his stroll. He was in a pleased mood. I returned at Sunset. At night there was the Wada Arti, &amp; Bhishma read Bhagavat, Dasbodh and then did Bhajan during which he sang some verses from Geeta &amp; Panchadasi of Baba Garde. Mr Balasaheb Bhate was present during the recital of the latter. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 8, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning Bhishma &amp; Bandu got up early &amp; had a musical prayer. It was very helpful. I prayed &amp; then we had our Panchadasi class. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out and later on I went to the Masjid. Sayin Maharaj very kindly called me by name and as soon as I sat down, he commenced a tale of his having had four brothers. He said he was very young and very intelligent. He used to play at his house which was very big and also at the Ashid Khana which was close by. Near it used to sit a very old man who would not go into either the Masjid or the Ashuskhana, saying that the place where he lay was his. His people did not wish it but Sayin Baba used to go to the Asher Khana also &amp; approved of the programme carried out there. The old man turned out to be his mother&rsquo;s father &amp; Sayin Baba always carried to him a bread &amp; something to eat it with. The old man was a leper, lost his fingers &amp; toes and daily grew worse, until at last he refused food &amp; died. Sayin Baba played near him, did not suspect that death was so near, &amp; talked about it to his mother who went to see her father. When Sayin Baba went, he found the old man gone &amp; his body converted into rice. Nobody would take charge of the clothes of the old man. Later on the rice disappeared, &amp; the old man was born again but associated with mangs. Sayin Baba gave him food &amp; then the old man was born a third time as the son of Kondaji. The boy played with Sayin Baba &amp; died a few months ago. At the midday Arti Sayin Baba approached me &amp; touched my left arm, and held his hand waist high, just as we do to indicate a young man. With the other hand he made a sign as we do to indicate a man passing away. He made a sign with his eyes. I did not understand the whole &amp; puzzled over it all day. In the afternoon we continued our Panchadasi class, finished Natyadeepa &amp; began Brahmanand. We saw Sayin Baba at his stroll &amp; after the Wada Arti, attended the Sheja Arti. Bhishma finished Bhagavat at night &amp; read Dasbodh. Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; came to it. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 9, Saturday </strong><br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Saheb appeared to be in very good mood. He blessed as usual by saying that God was higher than all. Then he passed away into the Masjid. I returned, prayed and was making ready for the Panchadasi class when Dhanjisha arrived from Bombay. He brought very good fruit for Sayin Saheb. We sat talking, saw Sayin Saheb as he went out. We held our class, but did not make much progress. I went to Masjid as usual. Sayin Saheb told the history of two sparrows that were sitting in the niche on the southern side of the &ldquo;Nimbar &rdquo;. He said the sparrows built their nest there &amp; used to sit as they were sitting at the moment. Death overtook them. It came in the form of a serpent which crawled round the &ldquo;nimbara &rdquo; &amp; swallowed them up. The sparrows are born again now &amp; have built their nest again exactly where it was before &amp; are sitting once more as they used to do. He said he never touched them, nor ever speak to them. He accepted Dhanjisha &rsquo;s Puja &amp; allowed the garland to remain on him much longer than he ever does. He liked the flowers &amp; ate a few grapes. Dhanjisha is of course staying with me. After meals I lay down for a while and then we held our class or rather continued it. We enjoyed the portion very much. At sunset we went &amp; saw Sayin Maharaj at his stroll. He was in a pleased mood but said that he did not care for buntings, but he wanted men. At night Bhishma read &ldquo;Swamibhava Dinkar &rdquo; &amp; Dasbodh. Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; also came. There was also Bhajan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 10, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, prayed and held our Panchadasi class as usual. Mr Waman Rao Pitale whose father served at Baroda, went away today with his wife, after a stay of a day &amp; requested me particularly to be mentioned to Mr Dixit on the return of the latter. We saw Sayin Baba go out &amp; I went to the Masjid on his return. He addressed me by name &amp;said that his father was very rich, had money buried in all imaginable places. Once he had a little difference with his father when he was very young &amp;went away to a place. It was a broad &amp; thick cactus hedge and he found a large treasure underground there. Sayin Saheb sat on it &amp; became converted into a big cobra. He sat on for sometime &amp; then felt inclined to go away. So he moved away to a neighbouring village and on the way regained his human form. Then he went to a lane where they killed men. He wandered there but was left unhurt. Then he went about begging and brought all the treasure trove in. The midday Arti passed off as usual and when I was returning he said &ldquo;Look here, he careful. Some guests will come; do not admit them &rdquo; all which meant that I shall have some disturbing influences &amp; I should withstand them. After the midday meal I lay down for a while &amp; then got a letter from Annasaheb Mutalik saying that Uma has become a lady. here is the religious and the social ceremony to be performed which means expense. Narayan Kamaukar writes from Amravati to say that they are all very hard pressed for money on all sides.So I understood the necessity of the warning given by Sayin Saheb. In the afternoon we continued our class and towards evening went to see Sayin Saheb at his stroll. At night there was the Wada Arti &amp;then Sheja Arti. The circle of fire fell &amp; broke today. Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; came at night as usual. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 11, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kakad Arti is done in a musical way and the lamps are waived by all. This morning the Kakad Arti was done in this way. Sayin Baba appeared very much pleased, used no hard words &amp; said that his father &amp; mother were there. He also told us to go to Wada. On my return I prayed &amp; held our Panchadasi class. The midday Arti passed off as usual &amp; I lay down after meal and in the afternoon continued our Panchadasi class. Towards evening we saw Sayin Saheb at his stroll. He was in a pleased mood. There was the Wada Arti &amp; Bhishma read Swamjibhava Dirkai &amp; Dasbodha and there was Bhajan afterwards. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 12, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I finished my prayer in the morning, news came that Nanasaheb Chandorkar was to arrive today. We held our Panchadasi class &amp; finished the work today. We had two pomogranades in honour of finishing the book. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out. I went to see him after he returned to the Masjid. As I sat down Sayin Saheb said &ldquo;People are very ignorant. When they do not see my physical body they think I am absent.&rdquo; He then said that he thought of Pimpalgaon this morning Pimpalgaon this morning,, then met four men from it &amp;they followed him to the Masjid. The conversation somehow turned to tokens connected with weddings &amp; Sayin Saheb pointing to the new wall that is being built said that there used to be a passage there &amp; a nim tree. An old man sat there &amp; he was very pious. He had come from Jalna &amp; did not care to return for over twelve years though his brother &amp; family suffered very much during his absence. At last he was prevailed upon to return. He did so on horse-back &amp; Sayin Saheb accompanied him in a cart. Arrived at Jalna, the old man stayed with his wife &amp; four grown up sons that he had, &amp; then suddenly decided to marry the daughter of his brother. The wedding took place, though every one laughed it to scorn. The bride was very young. At last she grew up, &amp; the old man had a son by her. Then the old man died when his son grew to six years of age. The boy was poisoned by Biradars. The young widow &amp; bereaved mother spent a chaste life, never remarried &amp;eventually died. The boy was born again as Babu &amp; died and is now born again in Bombay. Such is the artistic work of God. During the midday arti, Nanasaheb Chandorkar &rsquo;s family arrived &amp; he followed soon after. He had a feast &amp; all in the two Wadas were invited. It was nearly 5 P.M. when we finished. Baba Palekar came with Nanasaheb. He came from Amravati &amp; is staying with me. I naturally sat talking with him. My people are very badly off. I attended the evening stroll of Sayin Saheb. Mr Nanasaheb Chandorkar went with his family after the Wada Arti. After seeing him off I &amp;Balasaheb Bhat&eacute; attended the Sheja Arti at the Chavadhi. We at night a Haridas who happened to be here did kirtan telling a tale of telling a tale. The Haridas is from Bhusaval. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 13, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the Kakad Arti &amp;Sayin Saheb appeared very much pleased. Mr Dixit returned about 9 A.m. He has come alone leaving his wife behind. We sat talking &amp;could not hold our Panchadasi class. Strangely enough I felt sleepy &amp;lay down. We saw Sayin Maharaj go out and saw him later at the Masjid. He told a long story which in substance was that an old Patil used to visit him, that four and afterwards as many as twelve Govindas (detectives)used to watch him that the old man &amp; the Govindas had hard words, and once had a had a serious scuffle. Sayin Saheb favoured the old man, visited him in his field &amp; on one occasion hit the Govindas when they attacked him. At last the old man was moved to a large town for being dealt with, that Sayin Saheb intervened &amp; got him released. Baba Palekar got permission to take me away, tomorrow or Nu day after. We held our class in the afternoon &amp; saw Sayin Saheb at his evening stroll. At night there was Ramayan, Swamibhave Dinkar,&amp; Bhajan. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 14, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early, prayed and held our Panchadasi class. We revised a few of the earlier verses of the first Viveka. We saw Sayin Saheb go out and I went later to the Masjid on his return. Baba Palekar went before &amp; obtained permission for me to return to Amravati, tomorrow. The exact hour of starting appears unsettled. The midday Arti passed off as usual and after the midday meal I lay down for sometime. From Satara has come a Shastri to formally announce the news of the puberty of L.Sanshagyavati Uma. He also Saw Sayin Saheb. In the afternoon we continued our class and towards evening saw Sayin Maharaj at his stroll. At night there was the Wada Arti &amp; later on the Shej Arti. I attended both. Then Bhishma read a little of Swanubhava Dinakar &amp; Dasabodh. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 15, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi-Bhusaval</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning, prayed and attended the Kakad Arti. Sayin Baba got up pleased &amp;passed to the Masjid with good .The Rohila was today in a belicose mood &amp; I heard afterwards that he beat and broke the of Butya. I went to Masjid with Baba Palekar &amp; Mr Dixit. Sayin Baba was pacifying the Rohilla &amp; Butya. After he sat in his usual place Dixit moved about my permission to return to Amravati &amp; it was granted. So I returned &amp; told my wife to make ready for my departure. She will stay on with Bhishma &amp; Bandu a few days longer at Shirdi. I held the Panchadasi class &amp;finished the first chapter of it. Then I attended the midday Arti which passed off as usual. Mr Chandodkar arrived before it &amp; naturally attended. I had my meals in company with Dixit, Chandodkar &amp;others. After the meal I went with Palekar and met Sayin Saheb near the gate of the village. At his bidding we ran &amp; brought the Udi and took it from him. He told us to start at once blessing our journey with the words &ldquo;Allah Bhala Karega &rdquo;. So I hastily said goodbye to Bhate, Joshi, Dada Kelkar, Mr Chandodkar, Upasani, Durgabau. Mrs Kaulgi, &amp; Bapusaheb caught me up soon. Balaram &amp; young Dixit as well as Ramchandra were there. Bhai &amp; Keshava could not be found. We i.e. I &amp; Palekar left by tonga, reached Kopargaon at about 4 P.M. or a little later &amp; sat on the platform till 7 P.M. Many visitors of Shirdi including Navalkar &amp; Dr Ujinky turned up there &amp; we sat talking. We left by the train which leaves about 7 P.M. &amp; reached Manmad. There the N.W. passenger was waiting. So I got into it telling Palekar to take tickets &amp; get in. The train started soon &amp; I discovered afterwards that he did not get in There was a Traffic Inspector in my compartment. I told him all. He advised me to go on to Bhushaval &amp; wait for Palekar there. So I did. I am now waiting &amp; have neither a ticket nor a single pie. The Traffic Inspector is a good man but he got down at Jalgaon. I met Mr Deval&eacute; who is a ticket collector here. He advised me to wait either on the platform or in the train for Nagpur which is ready formed. I decided to do the latter. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 16, Sunday</strong> <br /><em>Bhusaval -Amravati</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The porter got me up at 5 A.m. &amp; on going to the platform I saw Baba Palekar come in. He told me that last night after my train left he saw the Manmad station master &amp;explained the situation to him &amp; pointed out how it arose through the remissness of his coaching clerk. The Station Master was a reasonable man, &amp; at once wired at Company &rsquo;s expense to all the inspecting stations viz Bhusaval, Badnera &amp; Amravat to pass me without any trouble. That is how every thing passed off well. Mr Deval&eacute; also came. Baba Palekar &amp; I left by Nagpur passenger. At Shegaon I met Mr Govind Raj &rsquo;s son Baba. He is the Sub Registrar. I was sorry to learn that Mr Govind Raj is not doing well. At Akola old Mr Mahajani came into my compartment and travelled to Amravati with me. We sat talking all the way, about general matters. He was on his way to attend some committee for moral &amp; religious instruction. At Amravati Narayan Dhamarkar &amp; Mahadeva were at the station. On reaching home I met Durge Shastri. He is very weak &amp;nearly blind. Then I bathed &amp; had something to eat. I tried to lie down but felt it very hot. So I sat reading the daily papers &amp; wrote. Kurandikar, Raghunath Rao Tikekar, Ranade, Asnare, Bhau Durani, Kaka Tarub&eacute;, Shriram Khatre, GopalRao Dole, V.K.Kal&eacute;, &amp; others came to see me during the day &amp; early in the evening and I sat talking with them about my stay at Shirdi, the mode of life there and the spiritual greatness of Sayin Saheb who is constantly present to my mind. We sat on the terrace for sometime. Gokhal&eacute; also came to see me. I feel tired and will retire early. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 17, Sunday</strong><br /><em>Amravati</em><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up rather late in the morning and after prayer tried to resume my old life. Some clients turned up and many came to see me. I sat talking with them. I wrote a few letters. Dr. Shahani came and at my suggestion agreed to perform an operation on the left eye of Durge Joshi on Wednesday next. There is a heavy case offered at Akola. Gor&eacute; also came with a Brahman from Konkan. Soon after our midday meal Mr Natekar known as Hamsa came from Akola, with Purohit. It was very kind of him to do so. He is a holy man, has practised yogic austerties and acquired higher powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sat talking with him. His experiences in Himalaya are unique and I never appear to tire of hearing about them. V.K.Kale and Karandikar came to go to our Theosophic lodge but having Hamsa with me I did not go. Towards evening Hamsa went out for a little airing. He had fever &amp; colic yesterday &amp; the day before. He had a little of it even today. I sat upstairs talking with Bamangaonkar, Waman Rao Joshi, Bhow Durrani, Baba Palekar Shriram &amp; others. Hamsa intends going away tomorrow.<br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 March 18, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Amravati</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spiritual surroundings of Shirdi are not here and I find myself considerably inconvenienced though Hamsa is under the roof &amp; he has a good powerful aura. I wished to get up as I used to do at Shirdi but could not and it was with great effort that I could finish my prayers before sunrise. Then I looked into today &rsquo;s appeal and dressing early &amp; eating something went to court. I met Mr Browne near his court and going into it got time in a case to put in our written statement. Then I went to the Court of Mr Price &amp;found him busy with a session &rsquo;s case. He could not hear the appeals so my work was finished. I went to the Bar Room &amp; found Palekar who accompanied me to Court, there sitting. I sat talking &amp; gave him three rupees to be made over to the secretary of the complimentary dinner to Major Morris. Tambe, Darule, &amp; Bhide came there, also Mr Narayan Rao Ketkar. After talking with them, I returned home with Gopalrao Dole &amp; Darule. Dole went to court with me in the earlier part of the day. On returning home I sat talking with Hamsa &amp; the people who came to see him. He was feeling slightly unwell. Later on he felt better. Then we went to Baba Palekar &rsquo;s house where Hamsa had some milk and fruits. Thence we went to the Railway station where I saw Nabob of Deolghat, old Mr Mahajani &amp; a number of others. Hamsa went by the evening mail to Mortugapur with Purohit. My son Baba &amp; a few others went to Badura with Hamsa, and I returned home. I sat upstairs, talking with such as came. Kurandikar, V.K.Kale, Waman Rao Joshi, Jayarum Patil &amp; others. Later on I received a letter from W.V.Joshi asking me to absent myself from Morris &rsquo; party on the ground that Mr Sly &amp; others would not like it. I do not understand the situation. It is a party by the Bar &amp; Bench &amp; I have every right to attend it. And does it matter if Mr Sly &amp; others do not like it. We sat talking for a long time. Durrani, Palekar, Gokhale, Wamanrao Joshi, Jaram Patil &amp; others. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 June 4, Tuesday </strong><br /><em>Amravati</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early, prayed &amp;sitting in the hall hunted up authorities from the Registration Act. Mr Asga Hussain came later on &amp; I drafted a petition for him to present at Yeotwal. After the midday meal I lay down but could not rest So I got up &amp; sat reading. Kelkar has put in a very good protest in the Maharalta against the action of the Bombay government in demanding security from Kesari. He has given translations of the alleged offending articles. The translations admit of improvement &amp;I thought of making the necessary amendments but for want of reference books &amp;on account of the excessive heat of the day I put off the work to tomorrow. I had my constitutional with V.K.Kale &amp; then sat talking with Buruangaonkar, Kesarisa and Bwaji. I have received today a letter written by Madhavarao Deshpande of Shirdi at the request of Sayin Maharaj ordering me to try and get Mr Karkhanis to take his wife back and treat her well. Sayin Maharaj says she is a very fortunate woman and her presence will do him (Karkhanis)&amp; me good. Karkhanis not here. I shall speak to him &amp; do my best when he returns at the end of the present vacation. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 June 5, Wednesday</strong> <br /><em>Amravati</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up somewhat earlier than usual, prayed and after spending sometime in walking in the verandah, sat in the hall. There were many letters to write in connection with the orders of Sayin Baba about Mrs Karkhanis. I wrote to Madhavarao Deshpand&eacute;, &amp; Gopal Rao Joshi at Shirdi &amp; also to Sayin Baba himself. Then I wrote to the father of Mrs Karkhanis. After the midday meal I lay down for a short while and then sat reading. I also wrote a few letters in the afternoon. V.K.Kale came earlier on purpose to read nxxxx nxxxx of the Upanishad but Mr Bhowjee Peshv&eacute; father of the pleader Peshav&eacute; of Yeotwal came &amp; we sat talking. Poor Peshwe has his brain affected. He does no work and what is the worst of all, hates his own people &amp; relations. The old father naturally feels very anxious. I had my evening constitutional with him and V.K.Kale. Bamangaonkar also came. We read a part of the essay written by V.K.Kale &amp; also Mandukya. There were many clients. I told them to come tomorrow morning. At night Bwaji &amp; Jayavantrao came &amp; we sat talking. <br />G.S.Khaparde.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 June 17, Monday</strong> <br /><em>Amravati</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early, prayed, &amp; sitting in the hall, drafted two appeal memos and later on with the help of Mr Asgar Hussain a petition for the Yeotwal client. This took up the whole of the morning. After the midday meal I lay down but found it too close and warm to rest. So I got up &amp; sat reading. It came on to rain in the afternoon &amp;continued to rain till night fall. A man from Karanja came &amp; told a long story, how there was a small association of young men to help the blind, lame &amp; poor, how it expanded collected small funds &amp; deposited them first with Bapusaheb Ghude, then with Jodha &amp; how finally one Paloskar got hold of it and never satisfactorily accounted for it. The police have got trace of it and they are making enquiries. Later on V.K.Kale, Asnare, Godbole &amp; our usual people came and we sat talking. The suit against Mudholkar has been filed. It is said to be for accounts. Then Mr Karkhanis came. I gave him Madhavarao Deshpande &rsquo;s letter written at Sayin Maharaja &rsquo;s request to read. He said he had great reverence for Sayin Maharaj &amp; would obey him in every thing except the matter of his wife. I asked him to go &amp;see Sayin Maharaj. He replied he would not do so now. At last I asked him to daily adore Sayin Maharaj &amp; he agreed to do so. After he went Bwaji came &amp;we sat talking. He brought a shoe-maker who measured my foot &amp; said he would make a slipper for me. Though it did not rain much, we feel pleased &amp; cool. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 June 18, Tuesday</strong> <br /><em>Amravati</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up early, prayed, and noted the authorities in Mutsui Bhushan Kuisha &rsquo;s case. I also looked into the papers of the evidence case before Mr Paranjape today. After an early breakfast I went to court with my son Baba &amp; Bhaw Durrani. The case before Mr Price was adjourned. I appeared before Mr Paranjap&eacute;. The other side had only two witnesses of whom they examined only one &amp;the case was adjourned. I then went to the Bar Room, looked for Kanga who could not be found and proceeded to the Small cause court. I had to wait there for about two hours &amp; more. Mr Kanga turned up after 3 P.M. Then the case was argued &amp; he had to admit one of our points. The case was adjourned and I returned home. Asnare was there but he appears for the other side. In the evening V.K.Kale, Asnare, Shamrao Deshpande, Karandikar &amp; others came &amp; we sat talking. I forgot to mention above that my third son Balvant returned this morning from Satara. He stayed a few days at Poona on the way and saw the Tilak family. He lived at Poona with Mr Bhusari. I wrote a letter to Madhavarao Deshpande of Shirdi giving full account of my interview with Karkhanis yesterday. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1912 July 27, Saturday</strong> <br /><em>Nagpur</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up early in the morning &amp;said my prayers walking in the garden. It used to rain a bit off &amp; on, and I had to seek shelter either under a tree or in a verandah. While I was bathing Mr Nilkanth Rao Uddhavaji came with Mr Pandit and his adopted son Bhaiya &amp; we sat talking. He was much interested in my visit to &amp; stay at Shirdi &amp; the talk was naturally about Sayin Maharaj. He invited me, Gopalrao Bootee &amp; Dorle to the midday meal at his house tomorrow &amp; we accepted the invitation on condition of his staying for breakfast with us which he did. The meal was late &amp; after it I lay down and was awakened by the arrival of Bhagirath Prasad, Ballal and Narayan Rao Alekar. We sat talking. Mr Nilkanthrao went away with Alekar. Later on I went with Dorle and Bhairulal who had come, to Dr Moonje &rsquo;s house. We sat talking there with a number of friends &amp; then went to the Kirtan in Ramamandir. It was by one Ghule but was a poor performance. We slept with Dr Moorj&eacute;. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p id="1913" style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1913 July 4, Friday</strong> <br /><em>Amravati</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I got up as usual prayed and wrote a few letters. Godbole came. After food I went to court with Godbole and appeared before Mr Morris. There was only one appeal that I had and it was soon finished as it was purely on evidence. Kly Kly. Deshpande appeared on the other side. After it I signed a few papers and returned home &amp; sat reading. The Guruashta of Shiralal Motilal of Hyderabad came to see me and sat talking. He is fond of Vedanta. While he was sitting Asnar&eacute; came and read out to me the story of King Avikshet. He wishes to dramatize it for being acted at the ensuing Ganpati Festival at Elichpur. It is a beautiful story and will be very interesting. We sat talking about it. Durrani came but went away very soon. The managing committee has revised the rules of the Berar Education Society. They would have to be submitted to and passed by the general body. I had my constitutional with Mirza Yad ali Beg. Appasaheb Watave came later on &amp; I sat talking with him. It being Friday there was no class today. Trimbak Rao who used to serve Sayin Maharaj when I was at Shirdi came today in the after noon. He says he is going to Jagannath, &amp; has completely changed his usual dress. He puts on now the kind of long shirt that Sayin Maharaj does and eats with it on. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>

L.C.Bupat was in the train joined it at Wardha. He, I &amp; Dorle drove in Bootees carriage. He got down near Bootees Mahal &amp; I with Gopal Rao Dorle proceeded to the Wada. I sat looking into today &rsquo;s second appeal. The clients came &amp; paid. After food I &amp; Dorle went to court &amp;our case was soon called. Sir B.K.Bhose was engaged on our side. Dillon, Joshi and Abhyankar appeared on the other side. Sir B addressed the court and argued the case very ably. Mr Dillon replied &amp; Joshi also added, as he said, a few words but they got lengthened into a speech. All this took the whole and it was nearly 5 P.M. when we finished. We drove to Bootee &rsquo;s Wada. L.C.Bapat again went away somewhere near the Rajaram Library. Mr Abhyaonkar came to see me &amp; we sat talking for a long time. It came on to rain also. Dr.Moonja came later &amp; sat talking about election matters. Savat Ram Rampratip &rsquo;s agent came to see us &amp; we sat talking. Ganpat Rao Nark&eacute; is here. So are all the children. Gopal Rao Bootee is at Shirdi. I had a long talk with Ganpat Rao Nark&eacute; about Sayin Maharaj of Shirdi. He is a great living saint.

My wife and children were there. I went to the Masjid with Madhavarao Deshpande and made my Namaskar to Sayin Maharaj. His health is very poor. He is much bothered by cough. I got the Morchal at Puja. The day here passes very easy. G.M.Bootee alias Bapusaheb is here with his master &amp; Gurashta. Kakasaheb Dixit, Bapusaheb Jog, Balasaheb Bhate &amp; all old friends are here, &amp; I am exceedingly happy. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>1915 December 30, Thursday</strong> <br /><em>Shirdi</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got up as usual in the morning, prayed and sat talking with one Karnik who turned out to be related to the late Amrit Rao Abaji. I sat talking with Fakir Baba who has advanced wonderfully and appears to be on the point of being permanently admitted to the spiritual hierarchy. I sat talking with him. Sayin Maharaj is getting slightly better. I did the Naivedya and Puja today. There were about a hundred people invited to breakfast which was very late. In fact we finished about 4 P.M. MadhavaRao Deshpande was as usual very useful. Bapu Saheb Bootee &rsquo;s Wada is progressing beautifully. It is a stone building &amp; very strong &amp; very convenient for occupation. There was Chavadhi today &amp; I attended it with Morchal. Ayisaheb is also unwell. Mr P.Hat&eacute; went today to Kalyana as his son in law is said to be unwell. Sayin Baba gave him a full coconut. So I think the young man will recover. <br />G.S.Khaparde</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1915 December 31, Friday</strong><br /><em>Shirdi -Bhusaval</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished to go to Masjid for Kakad Arti but felt disinclined at the last moment &amp; did not go. After morning prayer when I was going to the Masjid Rao Bahadur Sath&eacute; got hold of me &amp; took me to his Madi. There some eight gentlemen assembled &amp; told me that the arrangements 61 they wished to make for the Samsthana of Sayin Baba. They have a good scheme &amp; I made the suggestion that they should make no endeavour to collect monies from those whom Sayin Baba gave them. They approved of my advise. All this took time &amp; we were late for Arti, but we went in time and I had the chavari or rather mayur piccha. After food I went with Madhava Rao Deshpande and got permission without any difficulty for returning. My wife, Manu Tai, Uma &amp; children will remain behind. In the compound of the Masjid I met Wassudeorao Dada Piriplekar of Malkapur &amp; Mr Bhagavat Executive Enquirer of Kopargaon. I made ready and left by Balabhau &rsquo;s Tonga, reached Kopargaon had a talk with the station master. His assistant was at one time at Amravati.
