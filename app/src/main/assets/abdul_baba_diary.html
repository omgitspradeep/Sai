10. [K128] [The first two lines are written in Arabic - a quotation from the Qur'an]
     In the name of Allah the most beneficent and merciful. Allah... Husain... Love of Husain - Fatima
     First perform my work repeating the name of Allah, thereafter, like riding a horse, I will take you there. [There is an Arabic prayer.] You are the listener to our prayers. You are the deity of Worlds. We worship you and seek Your help. With Your blessings, O greatest of Mercifuls.

 

11. [K127] [The upper half of the page is in Arabic and in the lower portion reference has been made to the Hindu gods, Brahma and Vishnu who has taken 10 incarnations, the different names of Allah, and mantra and tantra.]
Hazrat Imam Hasan. Husain is the first and last Mehdi.

12. [K126] In the name of Allah the most beneficent and merciful.
     The religious emotion is purely spiritual. Only secondarily it relates to the material world. O Parvardigar! - Universal Sustainer. O God! O Habib! - My Beloved What we see in this material state is not real because you cannot understand it through the intellect or by inference. Those who consider the spirit as without beginning, this opinion is incorrect because thinking itself is not permanent. And life is the real thing. The body is subordinate to it... [last two lines are not clear]

13. [K125] [Copy of page 9]

14. [K124] To understand the true form of God is difficult. In the Qur'an it is forbidden to picture God with form. If you walk on the path of righteousness, then you will not feel the need for it. It requires great effort to walk on the path [of righteousness) i.e. tapas. When a person practices tapas (riyajat), divine insight (ma ºrifa) will automatically come. A sura from the Qur'an says something to this effect, Ajjain jahidu fina tabulana riyajat - He who performs tapas, I regard him to be on the path. It would not be proper to give him full knowledge about it. But before you proceed on the path of Allah, you must discipline the mind. It is strategic to strengthen the defences, with fortifications. If an army does not move how can the war of righteousness be fought. O dear friend! Know this that the body is the kingdom of the heart. Do not think that the heart has many armies. The Qur'an says: Maya alam rabbuk janud ilahu - The army of Allah, do not think that it has to beseige the mind/heart, The heart is created for the realization of God. To find the way to attaining a vision of God is a man's true task. For the vision of God, divine sight is necessary.

15-16. [K123-122] [This appears to be a two page copy of the well-known Arabic durud or prayer from the Qur'an which is recited to pay respects to the Prophet Mohammed. It is signed by:) Pirzadah Syed Noor. Syed Amin Khandhar, presently a scribe in an Urdu school at Shirdi.

17. [K121] [This page is all in Arabic, and is a supplicatory prayer (du'a), including the Fatiha from the Qur'an. It is
incomplete.]

18. [K120] [This page is all in Arabic.]
     [On this page is the Tajnama and prayers (du'as) as per Shi'i and Sunni schools of thought, indicating an equal reverence to both. Prayers have been offered to Allah and his various names, praying that he should save man from sins and satanic (evil) tendencies. The names of Allah aregiven]

19. [K119] [This page has Arabic verses from the Qur'an - Fatiha (1st sura) and a few verses from the second sura.

20. [K118] [The meaning is the same as page 12 [K126], but written at a different time, and longer by 4-5 lines) In the name of Allah the most beneficent and merciful. Religious emotion in full is purely spiritual. It is not material. Secondly it means that you will see the world as material or as only relatively real (until you have a vision of God). Parvardigar! O Dear One!, O Dear One! the material (relative state) world is unreal. There is no place for intellect and inference. Those who regard the spirit as without beginning, this is not true. It is wrong to address the spirit because it is dependent on others. The real form of man is prana - life force. The body is under the control of prana. The people who equate the spirit with the body are wrong. The body is impermanent. Animals also have a spirit which is also impermanent, called dil or heart which seeks the mercy of God.

21. |K117] [The ideas on this page are almost the same as on page 20.[K118]]

22. [K116] [This is the same as page 14 [K124]]
     It is difficult to know the true reality (haqiqa) or realize God (ma'rifa). The Islamic religious law (shari'a) does not permit any further probe into reality because it is beyond comprehension. We have to work hard on the Islamic religious path. Those who follow spiritual practices automatically have the realization of God (ma'rifa). Before efforts are put in, one should understand one's thought processes. How can one progress? The body is the kingdom of the heart and in this kingdom, there is something opposite to the mind. [There is an Arabic quotation:]

     Whoever has made efforts with a truthful heart, for the world hereafter, he has created a true path. He looks for a witness for God's works. This witness depends on true knowledge of God.

23-26. [K115-112] [These pages have scraps of modi script]

27. [K111] In the name of Allah most beneficent and merciful.
Allah says: We have created spirits (jinns) and man only for the purpose of worship. We have granted him the kingdom and the strength to conquer it. We have also given him the body, hands and feet, with the intention that he should enrich this world. In this way he repays our debt and becomes our true devotee. In this way, like the
Emperor, he serves the world and Allah.

28. [K110] Buddhi - intellect should be recognized as a wazir
(Prime Minister). Similarly the body, that is hands, feet etc., are the servants. The heart should be regarded as the treasurer - so greed and envy should be allotted the work of espionage, so that you will be able to know the information about the theft of wealth, and you will be able to attain your purpose. See the brain of the man is divided into two parts, front and back. The front portion receives the messages, so it is regarded as the reporter or the transmitter of information. The back portion is regarded as the protector of what is received - like a telegrap! officer or editor. [You should entrust or make proper uso of various organs and senses. And in the front portion o the brain is the power of thinking and analysing, while the back portion is memory.]

29. [K109] The wazir governs the administration of the kingdom and makes all the decisions and arrangements The buddhi - intellect should be regarded as a wazir of the Emperor, the mind. He should be able to control those conspiring against him. He has to be alert to who i rebellious. Likewise the intellect has to be ever vigilant to those enemies who wage war against the moral kingdom [The six enemies are anger, greed, jealousy etc.] It mus boost the morale of the obedient and put down rebellion so that the kingdom may survive.

30. [K108] One should not befriend evil-minded people. D. not be in league with them to commit theft or deceiv others. If one observes this discipline, then the purpose a life is fulfilled. They also are able to win grace of God On the other hand, if one acts against this one will b regarded as a thief or deceiver and people will regard on with suspicion. And one may also be punished for one bad conduct. O Dear Friend! There is a part within....

31. [K107] There are certain acts or types of behaviour whic destroy all goodness, Good acts form character and rais man's status. There are many types of behavious but fou are given here :

    Animalistic behaviour with traits of lust, anger & greed.
    Aggressive behaviour like that of a dog, wolf or tiger
    Satanic or evil behaviour.
    Angelic or divine behaviour.

32. [K106] A man who is not virtuous behaves like a sata but man has the intelligence, the virtue of which he ca behave like an angel. Strive always to perfect you knowledge, abjure from evil deeds, wish well to a people, and keep the bad and evil-minded persons at a distance. Live with honour, realizing the greatness of the nama (Name of God), always be happy. Know that ignorance, deceit and pretentiousness are vices. Truly speaking human nature is fourfold; dog-like, pig-like, satanic or angelic. A dog is not judged to be bad because of his skin but because of he symbolizes anger, and the pig greed. Man can be morally elevated above animalistic tendencies due to his discrination and intellect.

33. [K105] Nothing is bad because of its form or appearance, but it is bad because of the character which is under the control of desires which are unholy or which reflects animal qualities. It is the character which reflects the true nature, so the qualities of dogs and pigs are present in human nature, which determines whether a man is satanic or angelic. If you come to understand that there is an inner Controller, you come to assess your deeds and find out which of the four above qualities influence and predominate over you. Remember whatever actions you do, the corresponding qualities will develop and will always remain a part of you. These qualities constitute the core of morality and all these qualities will be according to the order of the one in command.

34. [K104] If you triumph over lust and anger they will not be able to keep you under their control. Then man has been commanded to keep the dog of greed and the pig of lust under control and subject them to the control of the discrimination. If a man does this, his character will enjoy the state of bliss. On the contrary if he comes under the control of vices, he will be totally ruined.

35. [K103] If a man is shown his true character he will see that he is standing with his hands tied before a pig, a dog or a satan (under the influence of the animal qualities of greed, rage or evil). If a musulman is made to stand before a kafir (a non-believer), the non-believer will torture him. An angel if he is subjected to a dog or a satan he will suffer far worse than the suffering meted out to a muslim by a non-believer.

36. [K102] If the external appearance is in conformity with the internal being, and if desires, such as greed are in the ascendant, that man will resemble a pig. And if anger is predominant, that man will look like a wolf. If you see this in a dream, note that man is like a tyrant.

37. [K101] If the appearance is under the control of the character then it will reflect what is within. If you realize that there is an inner Controller, then review your actions and way of living, and decide which of the four tendencies are predominant in you. Those qualities will arise in you according to the actions you perform and will always be your companions and these qualities arise according to the one who commands.

38. [K100] If you tie the pig of vices, then contentment, fear of God, humility, wisdom, goodness and meekness will arise in you. If you become a slave of the dog of vices, then insolence, impurity, pride, boastfulness, ego, false humility, regarding others as inferior, and keeping close to base types of people will become a part of your character. If you keep this dog under control, then success, honour, greatness and forgiveness will arise in you, and all these good qualities will be your companions till the last.

39. [K99] Vices, such as deceiving others, betrayal, embezzlement, insincerity, producing cheap shoddy goods, cunning, being devious in your dealings, unrighteous behaviour, destroying the faith of others, not being true to yourself, self-deceit (suppression of the conscience), all can overpower a man. Do not be under their control, triumph over them. If you truly discriminate - then wisdom, knowledge, learning, ingenuity, ability, good conduct, caring for the welfare of others, perseverance - all these good qualities will arise in you and will keep you company until the end of your life and will serve you well. Those actions which produce bad habits are called vices.

40. [K98] Light is like a clean mirror, one can see oneself. Bad habits are like the smoke or darkness which obscures the heart. But on the Day of Judgment in a new age, there will be a voice from heaven. Guard yourself and protect your virtue from the Doomsday. Good qualities are the light which sway the heart and destroy the stain and the feeling of guilt in you.

The left portion is somewhat indecipherable but names of divine incarnations such as Maccha, Kaccha, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parasurama, Ram, Krishna and Kalki are clearly decipherable. The right half side is translated thus:]
     Jali (water) avatar and then Thali (land) avatar. After this, there was the Brahmin Vamana and then the Rajput (Rama), then Gavli (Krishna) and then Musalmans. In the subloka all the people were indifferent. There were four avatars in krita yuga (Matsya, Kurna, Varaha and Narasimha) and three avataras in the treta (Vamana, Parasurama and Rama) and two avataras in dwapara yuga (Krishna and Balarama). Thereafter two avatars Shesha and Kalanki are listed, who are referred to in Islam as Mehdi and Alehussalman. After Maccha, Kaccha, Varaha, Narasimha, Parasurama, Krishna, they list Ibrahim, Kalanki, Alehussalman and Buddha.

48. [K90] [Page divided - topic the Remembrance of God - Namasmarana]

    Ya hayate kalandar, Ali Alauddin, Bande Nawaz, Mohammadshah.
    There are thousands of avatars in the Kaliyuga. The methods of worship for everyone are different. The present Kaliyuga avatar is Sai Baba. In this world there are always 10-20 avatars of similar kind living at the same time.
    God's power - do that which suggests itself to you. Many avatars have been born in this world and also in the kaliyuga. According to the conception of the Hindus from Vedic times, avatars rule and exercise great powers.

54. [K84] [Qawwali (Islamic devotional song) in honor of Sai Baba]

Every man is a slave of Sai Baba.
Spirits as well as men are captivated by Sai Baba.
God is our Beloved and takes the name of Sai Baba.
In the two worlds the name of Sai Baba resounds.
Sai Baba embodies the Vedas, as also Allah.
We give Sai Baba all honours respectfully saluting and bowing before him.
Sai Baba operates on two planes, in Shirdi and all over the world.
Sai Baba is Supreme in both the present world and the next.
The whole universe is vibrant with Sai Baba.

55.[K83] [Qawwali cont:]
     If one says ‚ÄúI do not get a son, Sai Baba can grant him a child.
That is the greatness of Sai Baba.
Even if you are not destined to get a fruit [child]
Whatever Sai Baba says will happen.
It is difficult to understand his deep mysteries
But that is his own idiosyncrasy.
His speech is like that of Maulana Gausul Ajaya Dastgir.
     He to whom he gives the chilim (pipe), they can command like him. [i.e. by his blessing they can also perform miracles]

56. [K82] [Qawwali cont:]
     No one understands his outer aspects. So, how can they understand his inner hidden qualities? Mysterious are the ways of nature.
     What capacity has Amir Saheb to talk about the qualities of our Sai Baba? The darbar (audience) of Sai Baba is that of a qalandar.
     Abdul is a slave of his and he is guided by him as his murshid (spiritual Master).

87. [K51] Mantra Aja Jana repeated over and over. Arabic quotation from the hadith, 'I am nur (light of Allah) and everything radiates from my divine light.'

88. [K50] [Hierarchy of saints - the page has poor calligraphy which is hard to decipher]

    Qutb al-aqtab the Supreme Qutb. Under him are 12 qutbs who are spread over the seven seas. If one dies another takes his place. They are like wazirs (ministers) with a staff under them.
    Under the qutb is one Ghaus.
    Lower than the ghaus are 2 Imams.
    Under them are 375 abdals spread over seven lands,who are the help of the helpless, and who live in forests and mountains. Forty of these abdals are called abrar [(not a separate category].

89. [K49] (not properly decipherable]
     5. Under them are 4 autads, who live in the four corners of the world. There is peace in the world due to these 4
autads.
     6. 4 Good men whose status is lower than autads.
    7. 300 persons who are constantly doing parayana (continuous reading) of the Qur'an day and night.

90. [K48] [This is a continuation of the hierarchy of saints on page K49]
     8. 70 najib (pl. nujaba] who take on the suffering of others and give solace to them.
     9. 7 akhyar, who always serve the religion of God (din haqq).
     10. 4,000 individuals who are living on this earth doing good pure works.
     11. Afrad whose number is beyond count, who are engaged day and night remembering God and in prayer (namaz).

91. [K47] [A Persian verse translated into Urdu]
How many ascetics really understand God?
     He who regards himself as equal to those who have attained the religious heights, i.e. saints, and regards them as just ordinary people has strayed from the path. He does not understand the sayings and conduct of the spiritual authorities. If he rebukes them it will be disgraceful. Remember that the abdals [category of saints) are
counted among the awliya Allah [friends of God]. They have derived special powers and capacities from God, appointed for special duties.

92. [K46] [Top portion of this page is not clear.]
     The external appearance is unreliable. What you see today is transient. Anybody can have doubts about it. Abdals are of different kinds and they are invested with authority according to their capacity. The population of the earth is divided into 7 kingdoms (aqlims). Therefore the number of abdals is also 7. Every abdal is governor or administrator of that direction and from time to time also looks after internal administration. Administration of this world is also controlled by an external force. Allah has also divided the internal kingdom. The earthly kingdom is entrusted to Emperors. Spiritual arrangements are entrusted to holy men, abdals, etc. Sometimes these people look after external administration for the management of the inner world is the same as the external material world.

93. [K45] Briefly speaking there are 7 spiritual kingdoms (aqlims) and 7 abdals who are entrusted with its administration. The abdal of the first kingdom is Ibrahim Khalilullah. The second is Mussah, the third is Harun, the fourth is Idris and the fifth is Yussuf. All of them have to walk in the footsteps of Allah.

94. [K44] [This page is in continuation of page 93; parts are not clear or intelligible.]
The seventh Divine is Adam who walks in the footsteps of God. By this is meant that he observes the duties prescribed by Allah for Paigambar (messenger of God). Accordingly the Divines of the first order is the way of Hazrat Paigambar Ibrahim. They have been given the status of Paigambar, therefore saints of this category are designated as abdals.

95. [K43] He is called a naqib who has knowledge of temporal affairs. As there are 12 constellations or planets (buruz) in the sky so there are 12 saints (naqib pl. nuqaba). Every naqib has the characteristics of his ruling planet and knows the effects of the planets. Every naqib has been given the knowledge of shar‚Äòiat (Muslim law), istikhraj (deductive logic), and fikrnaqush and hisabnaqush (detailed knowledge of the zodiac), and is aware of their deficiencies and the knowledge of how to remove the effects of those deficiencies.

96. [K42] If you are born on this earth, you can satisfy your quest for spiritual knowledge. Maulana Rumi says: A man should honour and have respect for great spiritual people who should be considered to be the best of creatures, and that honouring them should be the duty of each individual. Such behaviour is favoured by Allah. This is necessary in order to attain God. He who insults them will not get any boon or blessing from God.

97. [K41] That person who is devoid of the sense of taste cannot distinguish between sweet water and sour water. If the power of taste is damaged then one cannot distinguish them. Similarly only that person who has the taste or experience of the power of God, he alone can realize God. Those who have not had divine insight can never have self-realization. Only a goldsmith can distinguish gold from other metals. Similarly, the beauty of a flower can be known by a bul bul (Urdu poets refer to the black minar bird).

98. [K40] [Verse at the top in poetry]
‚ÄòA discriminating gourmet alone appreciates the taste of fine food'.
     Maulana Rumi says, only a person who has tasted misry (sugar) or those whose tongue has the power to taste sweetness, will know the quality of sweetness. Those who have not tasted or who have lost their power of taste, will not know. To him there will be no difference between wax and honey! In the same way Maulana Rumi means that those who do not have a taste for ‚Äòirfan or spiritual knowledge, how would they know the eminence of the awliya, appreciate their hierarchy, or recognize those born as Paigambars, or Great Divines?. To him these people will appear just like himself, but in fact there is as much distinction between earth and sky as between himself and the saints and prophets.

99. [K39] In order to reach a higher stage of spirituality (Godrealization), it is necessary to practice severe renunciation and celibacy. That means he should be awake at day and night, stay away from women, abjure from delicious food and reside in jungles and mountains. The common people of our times regard this as a test of perfection because in religious matters, staunch discipline and strict control over desires is considered to be the dharma.

100. [K38] Quotation from the Qur'an saying that austerity is accepted by Islam.
Do not be attached to your life - Allah will also tie you down because austerity is accepted by Islam. A man in whom the above qualities manifest in his sayings and conduct, must be in conformity with the Islamic law (Shariat) hadith and the great Divines. Then only he reaches the higher stages.
[The lower half portion is not clearly decipherable.]

101. [K37] [This page gives a line of succession of divines.]
Your test is that you observe the highest degree of renunciation (in the mind).
Shaikh Ahmad of Turkestan, who is the greatest Pir of Turkestan was the
murid of Khwaja Khalifa Yusuf Hamdani, who was
murid of Khwaja Abu Ali Pharmadi who was
murid of Abul Qasim Gurgani who was
murid of Usman Maghrabi who was
murid of Shaikh Ali Katib who was
murid of Shaikh `Ali Rudbarani who was
murid of Khwaja Junayd Baghdadi

102. [K36] Khwaja Junayd Baghdadi is called alawi because he is a follower of Ali (Shiya). Shaikh Bin, Ibrahim Bin,Mahommed Ilyas Bin, Iftikhar Bin, Usman Bin, Musa Bin, Haroon Bin, Ishaq Bin, Yasin Bin, Abdul Rahman Bin, Ismail Abu Mahommed Bin, Abdul Jalin Bin, Abdul Fattah Bin, Amir Abu Mohammed, Haif Ba Mustara.

103. [K35] Maulana Rumi says that the observance of severe austerity, is a prerequisite for attaining higher levels of spirituality. You should be awake day and night, remain away from women, avoid rich food, reside in the jungles and mountains. Ordinary people of our times regard this as the highest form of austerity because of the severity of the conditions imposed in religious matters, and the control over desires. God's messenger, Mohammed - Peace be upon him, is also of the same view.

104. [K34] [The holy hadith says] Do not be attached to your life because God will also tie you down. This means that renunciation is acceptable to Islam. Briefly speaking, the person in which the aforesaid virtues manifest and whose word, thought and deed are in conformity, will be respected and the sayings of Islamic saints will be counted as among the great, and because of such people sin can be expiated. A man embodying these qualities is fit to be a murshid and it is fortunate to be a disciple of such a one.

105. [K33] [The page starts with a quotation from Maulana Rumi's poetry in Persian.]
     The poet Shiraz says, ‚ÄúThat Sufi who is not pure (safi) will earn the wrath of God.'
     These people are Satans in human form therefore do not praise the evil-minded. Do not help them. Maulana Shiraz says, the speech of some is not pure. Some faqirs are so wicked that we feel like taking away their kafni and consigning them to the fire. O mind, Beware! Be Awake! This dangerous wall of the world (separating you from God) is fleeting, and so to engross yourself in it, is truly madness. The divine beings who have come adorned with a wealth of virtues have come here to acquire spiritual
goods for the other world. Do not be a broker in this world, otherwise you will not gain the wealth of the other world.

106. [K32] He who loses the genuine eye ointment and buys false pearls and synthetic goods, which are without any value in the world, such people will only be humiliated and will have to repent ultimately. O people! Beware of such false pirs and faqirs. Outwardly they are men in appearance - but in their hearts they are satanic. These people regard the dance and song of the prostitute etc., as the best of Sufi (Chishti) mode of worship. And some of them boast about being Sayyads or Pirzadas or Shaykhs. Truly speaking they have lost the favour of God. [...not clear after this]

107. [K31] It is very necessary to protect yourself from those who invite you in the path leading to satan, and who indulge in evil activities. A description has been given in the biographies of the Sufi saints (awliya). "He who has not seen the pathway to Allah remains blind in the world - then he wanders like a blind man among people. He is not able to see God. Please show your beatific form of yours. I am a very meek slave of yours.'

108. [K30] One who has not discovered the gate or way to God remains blind in the world, even though he stays amongst the people because he is not able to see God.


Prayer:
Kudha! [God] Let me see your beatific form - I am a meek helpless slave of yours - not remembering the path which leads to you. I am wandering. O friend! this is the meaning of that saying. He who has been sinning in this world, like a blind man straying from the path, he is not discovering the gateway to God so he wanders from door to door.

109. [K29] When in the nimbar (niche) of your heart, the Beloved is enthroned, what is the need for the pesh-iman (priest)? If we can achieve ivadat (our end) by prayer to God (Allah), what is the necessity to go to the masjid to listen to the Kutba. If all the time we are engrossed in devotion to God, why should we do namaz five times a day, in the morning, noon etc.? If we are all in love with the Beloved, we will go and reside in the mandir - why should we go to and visit the ka ‚Äòba in Mecca?

110. [K28] What is namaz? Why fast (roza) [in the month of Ramadan]? At present I am engaged in heresy if I ask what is qalam? When the Beloved is enthroned in the heart how can we see the pesh-imams? If we are ever engrossed in prayer, meditation on Allah, or performing service - what need is there to go to the masjid, the dargah (shrine) or listen to the Qutba? During the eight watches of the day (24 hrs) we are engaged in the the remembrance of the Beloved. What is the need for us to perform the five times a day namaz - subah, zuhr, asr, magrib and isha?


Quotation from a ghazal.
We are in the embrace of the love of the Beloved. We shall go and reside in the mandir and stay there. We will make collections and think of the non-believers. We have no interest in visiting the ka'ba [in Mecca]. The face of the Beloved is engraved on my heart. Why should we do prostrations (sajda) and salaam? Why namaz, why fast? According to the Shari'at I should be engaged in all these practices. Then what is all this qalam [I am nonconformist]

111. [K27] [The hierarchy of saints is given]
The Qutb-al-aqtab is the highest of all the qutbs. Under him are 12 qutbs who are like the Prime Minister and Administrators. If one dies, another immediately occupies that position. Lesser than qutbs are the Ghaus or Helpers of the age. There are 2 Imams who are lesser status than the Ghaus. There are 7 abdals who look after the oppressed ones.

112. [K26] There are 357 lower abdals who are subordinate to the 7 Abdals and they live in the jungle and mountains. 40 among these abdals are known as abrar. There are 4 autad, one in each of the four directions, N,S E & W. They care for the functioning of the world and settling the population. In the fifth category there are 4 men who are lower in order to the autad. In the seventh category there are 300 called Nuqaba who are ever repeating 'Allah' at all times. There are 4 pirs and 14......?

113. [K25] In the eighth category there are 70 najibs who take upon themselves the sufferings and problems of others to relieve their burden. In the ninth category there are 7 akhyars who always help to support the religion of God din-haqq [Islam]. In the 10th category there are 4000 mikwana living all over the earth, who are constantly engaged in good deeds. In the 11th category there are a great number of people (other than the 4000) called Ifad who are highly spiritual and are ever engrossed in devotion, prayer and singing the names of God.

114. [K24] Five questions have been raised in the beginning of this page. Where is mushaf, the sacred writing of the Qur'an Sharif, in the body of man? Where is faith (mu'min)? Who is a Musalman? Who is a non-believer (kafir)? Who is a traveller?
The answers are: The head is 'mushaf' - scrolls are in the head, which contain wisdom, knowledge ('aql). The heart is 'mu'min' the seat of full faith. The tongue is musalman'. The 'ego' or desires are ‚Äòkafir'. The spirit ‚Äòruh' is the 'musafir' or traveller.


Question: Why is one kalima not enough for true faith? Why are we told that five are necessary? There are 5 Sufi kalimas, each with a specific purpose of purification:

    Kalima tayyiba for purification of the heart.
    Kalima shahada for purification of the speech [la Ilaha illa 'llah]. [I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that Mohammad is the Apostle of God)
    Kalima tamjeed for purification of the chest [Allah is One].
    Kalima tauhid for internal purification. 5. Kalima [word missing] for purification and strengthening of faith (iman).

115. [K23] May Allah shower peace on the spirit of Hazrat Paigambar who realized the Light of Allah. He is the Knower who has realized the Divine Principle within. O Disciple! Listen! The rewards are of six types. Know and remember completely how the mind works. May the Light Supreme ever grow in radiance. In the Qur'an Sharif it has been stated that the earth was created in six days.

    From God (zat) was created light (nur).
    From light was created the innermost heart where
    divine revelation is experienced (sirr).
    From the inner heart, spirit (ruh) was created.
    From spirit, the heart (dil) was created
    From the heart are the desires (nafs).
    Ego-self or lower nature (nafs)

     In nature is contained light. O Disciple! First of all establish control over your desires. See within the heart the Divine Principle.

116. [K22] [the numbering does not quite accord with the previous page - but the meaning is there]
     The third stage is spirit (ruh); the fourth stage is innermost heart (sirr); the fifth is divine light (nur); and the sixth stage is zat, divine nature. Therefore we should first be aware of the desires (nafs) and then proceed to the heart. After seeing the light of the spirit enlightening the heart, see ruh or spirit in it and then reach the head. From this stage we reach the nur and in nur there are all the signs of zat - divine nature. God is just like the quality of sweetness in sugar, the fragrance in flowers, the curds in milk, the butter in curds, and the ghee in butter (clarified). Step by step you should proceed with the Grace of God and you will reach your desired desination.

[An Arabic quotation is given:]
     May God shower the peace and spirit of Paigambar. One who has recognized the Light of Allah is the true Knower.

117. [K21] These chahal tan - 40 men [Sufi divines] have experienced God directly and are God-realized.'

119. [K19] We all ought to perform prayers (namaz) but the difference is that some do it whole-heartedly and others only for appearance. God alone knows his own ways. We have heard from many astrologers and soothsayers, and taken notice of other people but the real secret of Khuda [God] is not known to anyone. Someone pretends to become a pir, showing his skills, attracting and influencing people in order to fill his coffers and amass wealth. God alone knows his ways. He pretends to be a puritan master (murshid). If you are a true character you will beware of such pretenders. They pretend to be orthodox, to fast (roza) and take the guise of holy persons. Shafi says that enemies of Islam may have been rewarded and many may appear to remain unpunished by following these false practices. But beware of such people for Allah knows his ways!

120. [K18] When the pen is in the hands of wicked persons, why should not Mansur [al-Hallaj] be put on the gallows. Pujaris who perform worship and eat forbidden food [they are not true Brahmans]. God only knows his own ways. There are thousands of mullahs (teachers), thousands of alims (scholars), hundreds of thousands of mufti (jurists), millions of qadis (judges). Most of these people have started taking bribes. Allah only knows his ways. When the pen is in the hands of the wicked, why should Mansur not be hanged?

     There have been times when man raised himself to such a level that even the angels prostrated before him, so why does man lower himself now? O Shahbaz (the royal falcon), your place is high in the sky. Man is like the falcon. When he possesses good qualities he is like Shahbaz, and can fly spiritually high.

121. [K17] & 122. [K16] [The names of forty Sufi divines. This is a repeat of pages 117 [K21] - 118 [K20]].
     The horses of reasoning run amok and enter into controversies. If a pujari (Hindu priest) meets another pujari, if a wahabi (member of a puritan sect of Muslims) meets another wahabi - their sense runs amok.

122. [K15] [Some illegible modi script]

124. [K14] In the presence of your father (Allah), all the angels stand with their heads bowed in reverence before him. Why do you aspire to be the light? You are like the mythological eagle Shahbaz who always flies high. Your throne is in heaven. When the pen is in the hands of a wicked person, why should Mansur not be put on the gallows?

125. [K13] In the heart of man are four gems.

    Ilm - Knowledge. The place of ilm is in the chest.
    Aql - Intelligence, reason is in the head.
    Sabr - Patience, contentment is in the stomach.
    Iman - Faith in God is in the heart.

The enemy of knowledge (ilm) is pride.
The enemy of reason (aql) is anger.
The enemy of patience (sabr) is greed.
The enemy of faith in God (iman) is untruth.

 

126. [K12] [Four elements are given, with their colours, associated individuals and angels]

    Zamin - earth is associated with the colour yellow and with the Musulmani angel Gabriel.
    Water is associated with Michael and Amir Mohammed. shakti (power) or Parvati. White is its colour.
    Isra'fil, the angel which blows the trumpet at the time of the destruction of the world. Green is its colour.
    Mehdi Alehuslam - after the names of holy men are repeated. My peace be upon them. Isra'fil that is fire - atish is associated with malik al-maut the angel of death. Red is its colour, and the colour of anger is also red.


127. [K11] Vishnu is equal to the Bismillah ar-Rahim, Allah the Merciful the Pardoner. Ali is equal to Brahma. Mahadev is equal to Mohammed and to Malik al-maut, the angel of death.

135. [K3] [Hindu mantra or spell] Brahma the Creator created the three worlds, the earth, the heaven and the nether lower regions. Vishnu is the source of the ten incarnations [dasavatars]. The Veda enables you to cross the ocean of samsara, and after you cross there is no cause for misery or suffering. Chanting of the scriptures at home is helpful and worship of the murtis (idols). The sun is one with Brahma and is the mine of the gunas. On the day of the dark phase of the moon, recitation of shanti path for the pacification of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars [is performed]. Chhoo Mantar! - Go away!

In the name of Allah, the most beneficent and merciful.
At my door is Allah - in front of me is Ali's son Hasan, behind me is Fatima and Husain. My saviours are Hasan and Husain, the two handsome youths. I praise them. Daud, Sulyman, and Ali are my protectors. There is no other God but Allah and Hazrat Mohammed is his messenger

Note:

     This is the english translation of Abdul baba's diary which was originally written in Urdu. Green numbers in each paragraph indicates the page number from the diary, however there are many unreadable parts, gaps, unfinished thoughts, unfinished lists etc. because this notebook was never intended for publication. The original copy of Abdul baba's work was in possession of Mrs. Marianne Warrer of Toronto, Canada which was presented to authors of book "Sai Baba of Shirdhi a Unique Saint". The story of Abdul baba is written in "Devotee's Experiences of Sri Sai Baba" which is narrated by himself when interviewed by author Narasimha Swami. About his diary Abdul baba said:

    I went on writting down what Baba was uttering. This is the book which contains the gracious uttering of Baba. Everything which fell from his lips is sacred.
    When anyone comes and states the problem- I consult this book of Baba's utterances and the answer that comes out of the page opened comes out correct. This has been tried and proved many times. This gift of prophecy is due to Baba's grace.

Abdul Baba passed in 1954.
